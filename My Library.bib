  abstract = {In the honey bee (Apis mellifera), queen and worker castes originate from identical genetic templates but develop into different phenotypes. Queens lay up to 2000 eggs daily whereas workers are sterile in the queen's presence. Periodically queens stop laying: during swarming, when resources are scarce in winter, and when they are confined to a cage by beekeepers. We used confocal microscopy and gene expression assays to investigate the control of oogenesis in the ovaries of honey bee queens that were caged inside and outside the colony. We find evidence that queens use a different combination of `checkpoints' to regulate oogenesis compared to honey bee workers and other insect species. However, both queen and worker castes likely use the same programmed cell death pathways to terminate oocyte development at their caste-specific checkpoints. Our results also suggest that a key factor driving the termination of oogenesis in queens is nutritional stress. Thus, queens may regulate oogenesis via the same regulatory pathways that were utilised by ancestral solitary species but likely have adjusted physiological checkpoints to suit their highly-derived life history.},

  abstract = {Anopheles gambiae Giles sensu stricto (Diptera: Culicidae) is the major Afro-tropical vector of malaria. Novel strategies proposed for the elimination and eradication of this mosquito vector are based on the use of genetic approaches, such as the sterile insect technique (SIT). These approaches rely on the ability of released males to mate with wild females, and depend on the application of effective protocols to assess the swarming and mating behaviours of laboratory-reared insects prior to their release. The present study evaluated whether large semi-field enclosures can be utilized to study the ability of males from a laboratory colony to respond to natural environmental stimuli and initiate normal mating behaviour. Laboratory-reared males exhibited spatiotemporally consistent swarming behaviour within the study enclosures. Swarm initiation, peak and termination time closely tracked sunset. Comparable insemination rates were observed in females captured in copula in the semi-field cages relative to females in small laboratory cages. Oviposition rates after blood feeding were also similar to those observed in laboratory settings. The data suggest that outdoor enclosures are suitable for studying swarming and mating in laboratory-bred males in field-like settings, providing an important reference for future studies aimed at assessing the comparative mating ability of strains for SIT and other vector control strategies.},

Mating occurs in aerial swarms with a high male-to-female ratio, where traits underlying male mating success are largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) influence mating success in natural mating swarms in Burkina Faso. As insecticides are widely used in this area for malaria control, we also determined whether CHCs affect insecticide resistance levels. We find that mated males have higher CHC abundance than unmated controls, suggesting CHCs could be determinants of mating success. Additionally, mated males have higher insecticide resistance under pyrethroid challenge, and we show a link between resistance intensity and CHC abundance. Taken together, our results suggest that CHC abundance may be subject to sexual selection in addition to selection by insecticide pressure. This has implications for insecticide resistance management, as these traits may be sustained in the population due to their benefits in mating even in the absence of insecticides.},

  abstract = {Insects are a result of culmination of evolutionary development and vast majority of them occupy different ecological niches. The huge number and great diversity of insects have lead them to express diverse behavioural patterns. The study of animal behaviour is termed `ETHOLOGY'. Behaviour is the way in which organisms adjust to and interact with the environment. Most behavioural patterns of insects are generally determined and thus behaviour is `stereotyped'. In insects, since the behavioural patterns are essentially the outcome of inherited properties and such patterns are innate. However, some learned patterns are also exhibited by insects. The movement of insects are highly dependent on rhythmic and light reactions. Chemicals like hormones, pheromones also play an important role in modifying behavioural patterns of insects. Insect behaviour has been manipulated and used in many pest management practices. It is also used in identifying species. Behavioural characters like sound and light production, host associations, nest constructions, pheromones, reproductive patterns have pertinent role in separation of closely related taxa or sibling species. The recent use of insect behaviour is the extraction of GFP (Green Flouroscent Protein) which is used for tagging and learning the expression of certain genes. Thus it is necessary to understand the basic behavioural patterns in insects for the behavioural manipulation and their use in successful and eco-friendly management of insect pests.},

Thus, in order to have eggs available within this two-hour window, it is important to understand the ovipositional behavior of Anopheles gambiae s.s.. In the present study, the ovipositional behavior of An. gambiae s.s. (Kisumu) was investigated in several different conditions: age of mosquitoes, time post blood meal to access oviposition substrate, and light conditions. Two groups of mosquitoes, 3-5 days old and 9-11 days old were blood-fed. For those mosquito groups, an oviposition dish was set either at 48 hours or 72 hours after the blood meal either in a light condition or in an artificial dark condition. The number of laid eggs was compared among the different conditions. The 3-5 day-old mosquitoes apparently produced a higher number of eggs than 9-11 day-old mosquitoes, while there was no significant difference between the two groups. The number of laid eggs per one surviving blood-fed mosquito in the dark condition was significantly higher than that in the light condition (p = 0.03). Providing an oviposition dish at 72 hours after blood meal resulted in a significantly higher number of laid eggs per one surviving blood-fed mosquito than at 48 hours after blood meal (p = 0.03). In conclusion, the optimal condition to have readily available egg supply for transgenic analysis was as follows: 3-5 day-old mosquitoes with an oviposition dish placed at 72 hours after the blood meal in a dark environment.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Mosquitoes are vectors of a number of important human and animal diseases. The development of novel vector control strategies requires a thorough understanding of mosquito biology. To facilitate this, we used RNA-seq to identify novel genes and provide the first high-resolution view of the transcriptome throughout development and in response to blood feeding in a mosquito vector of human disease, Aedes aegypti, the primary vector for Dengue and yellow fever. We characterized mRNA expression at 34 distinct time points throughout Aedes development, including adult somatic and germline tissues, by using polyA+ RNA-seq. We identify a total of 14,238 novel new transcribed regions corresponding to 12,597 new loci, as well as many novel transcript isoforms of previously annotated genes. Altogether these results increase the annotated fraction of the transcribed genome into long polyA+ RNAs by more than twofold. We also identified a number of patterns of shared gene expression, as well as genes and/or exons expressed sex-specifically or sex-differentially. Expression profiles of small RNAs in ovaries, early embryos, testes, and adult male and female somatic tissues also were determined, resulting in the identification of 38 new Aedes-specific miRNAs, and {\textasciitilde}291,000 small RNA new transcribed regions, many of which are likely to be endogenous small-interfering RNAs and Piwi-interacting RNAs. Genes of potential interest for transgene-based vector control strategies also are highlighted.

In most couplings, males were actively displaced by female kicks in the early phases of the interaction, while flight cessation prior to adoption of the pre-copulatory mating pose also inhibited copulation. Successful males were kicked at a reduced rate and sustained paired contact-flight for longer than those that were rejected. We identified two distinct phases of acoustic interaction. Rapid frequency modulation of flight tones was observed in all interactions up to acceptance of the male. Harmonic convergence (wingbeat frequency matching) was detected more often in successful attempts, coinciding with the transition to stabilised paired flight and subsequent genital contact. Our findings provide a clearer understanding of the relationship between acoustic interactions and mating performance in mosquitoes, offering insights which may be used to target improvements in laboratory reared lines.},

The acoustic interactions of tethered live pairs of               Aedes aegypti               mosquitoes, from same and opposite sex mosquitoes of the species, are recorded on independent and unique audio channels, together with the response of tethered individual mosquitoes to playbacks of pre-recorded flight tones of lone or paired individuals. A time-dependent representation of each mosquito's non-stationary wing beat frequency signature is constructed, based on Hilbert spectral analysis. A range of algorithmic tools is developed to automatically analyse these data, and used to perform a robust quantitative identification of the `harmonic convergence' phenomenon. The results suggest that harmonic convergence is an active phenomenon, which does not occur by chance. It occurs for live pairs, as well as for lone individuals responding to playback recordings, whether from the same or opposite sex. Male--female behaviour is dominated by frequency convergence at a wider range of harmonic combinations than previously reported, and requires participation from both partners in the duet. New evidence is found to show that male--male interactions are more varied than strict frequency avoidance. Rather, they can be divided into two groups: convergent pairs, typified by tightly bound wing beat frequencies, and divergent pairs, that remain widely spaced in the frequency domain. Overall, the results reveal that mosquito acoustic interaction is a delicate and intricate time-dependent active process that involves both individuals, takes place at many different frequencies, and which merits further enquiry.},

However, others facilitate observations that would be difficult to make on real organisms, for example on the flow of air around the wings of small insects. Mathematical models have been used more often than physical ones. Some of them are predictive, designed for example to calculate the effects of anatomical changes on jumping performance, or the pattern of flow in a 3D assembly of semicircular canals. Others seek an optimum, for example the best possible technique for a high jump. A few have been used in inverse optimization studies, which search for variables that are optimized by observed patterns of behaviour. Mathematical models range from the extreme simplicity of some models of walking and running, to the complexity of models that represent numerous body segments and muscles, or elaborate bone shapes.

The color of a food resource, such as a flower or warm-blooded host, can be dominated by long wavelengths of the visible light spectrum (green to red for humans) and is likely important for object recognition and localization. However, little is known about the hues that attract mosquitoes or how odor affects mosquito visual search behaviors. We use a real-time 3D tracking system and wind tunnel that allows careful control of the olfactory and visual environment to quantify the behavior of more than 1.3 million mosquito trajectories. We find that CO               2               induces a strong attraction to specific spectral bands, including those that humans perceive as cyan, orange, and red. Sensitivity to orange and red correlates with mosquitoes' strong attraction to the color spectrum of human skin, which is dominated by these wavelengths. The attraction is eliminated by filtering the orange and red bands from the skin color spectrum and by introducing mutations targeting specific long-wavelength opsins or CO               2               detection. Collectively, our results show that odor is critical for mosquitoes' wavelength preferences and that the mosquito visual system is a promising target for inhibiting their attraction to human hosts.},

  abstract = {The African malaria mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii range over forests and arid areas, where they withstand dry spells and months-long dry seasons, suggesting variation in their desiccation tolerance. We subjected a laboratory colony (G3) and wild Sahelian mosquitoes during the rainy and dry seasons to desiccation assays. The thoracic spiracles and amount and composition of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) of individual mosquitoes were measured to determine the effects of these traits on desiccation tolerance. The relative humidity of the assay, body water available, rate of water loss and water content at death accounted for 88\% of the variation in desiccation tolerance. Spiracle size did not affect the rate of water loss or desiccation tolerance of the colony mosquitoes, as was the case for the total CHCs. However, six CHCs accounted for 71\% of the variation in desiccation tolerance and three accounted for 72\% of the variation in the rate of water loss. Wild A. coluzzii exhibited elevated desiccation tolerance during the dry season. During that time, relative thorax and spiracle sizes were smaller than during the rainy season. A smaller spiracle size appeared to increase A. coluzzii's desiccation tolerance, but was not statistically significant. Seasonal changes in CHC composition were detected in Sahelian A. coluzzii. Stepwise regression models suggested the effect of particular CHCs on desiccation tolerance. In conclusion, the combination of particular CHCs along with the total amount of CHCs is a primary mechanism conferring desiccation tolerance in A. coluzzii, while variation in spiracle size might be a secondary mechanism.},

This review offers a comprehensive biological background followed by comparative analysis of recent models of locust collective motion, in particular locust marching, their settings, and underlying assumptions. We describe a wide range of recent modeling and simulation approaches, from discrete agent-based models of self-propelled particles to continuous models of integro-differential equations, aimed at describing and analyzing the fascinating phenomenon of locust collective motion. These modeling efforts have a dual role: The first views locusts as a quintessential example of animal collective motion. As such, they aim at abstraction and coarse-graining, often utilizing the tools of statistical physics. The second, which originates from a more biological perspective, views locust swarming as a scientific problem of its own exceptional merit. The main goal should, thus, be the analysis and prediction of natural swarm dynamics. We discuss the properties of swarm dynamics using the tools of statistical physics, as well as the implications for laboratory experiments and natural swarms. Finally, we stress the importance of a combinedinterdisciplinary, biological-theoretical effort in successfully confronting the challenges that locusts pose at both the theoretical and practical levels.},

New approaches for vector control are needed. The females of               Anopheles gambiae s.l.               mate once in their life and in the swarms formed by males. Trapping swarms of               Anopheles gambiae s.l.               males~is a potential new intervention for vector control, alternative to the use of insecticides, as it would disrupt mating~. The proof-of-concept pilot study~aiming at investigating swarm trapping as a potential vector control intervention,~was carried out in 6 villages as in eastern Gambia. Swarms of               Anopheles gambiae s.l.               were identified and their size, height, and duration determined during the baseline year. Swarm trapping by local volunteers was implemented the following transmission season in 4 villages while the other 2 villages were taken as controls. Entomological outcomes were monitored by Human Landing Catches and Pyrethrum Spray Catches. A cross-sectional survey to determine malaria prevalence was carried out at the peak of the malaria transmission season for two consecutive years. At baseline, 23 swarming sites of               Anopheles gambiae s.l.               were identified. Before the intervention, mean indoor resting density per house and malaria prevalence were similar between control and intervention villages. Following the intervention,               Anopheles gambiae s.l.               indoor resting density was 44\% lower in intervention than in control villages (adj IRR: 0.0.56; 95\% CI 0.47--0.68); the odds of malaria infections were 68\% lower in intervention than in control villages (OR: 0.32; 95\% CI 0.11--0.97). Swarm trapping seems to be a promising, community-based vector control intervention that could reduce malaria prevalence by reducing vector density. Such results should be further investigated and confirmed by larger cluster-randomized trials.},

Swarms and breeding sites were searched and sampled between January and December 2010, and larval and adult samples were identified by PCR. During the dry season, 456 swarms of An. gambiae s.l. were sampled from 38 swarm sites yielding a total of 23,274 males and 76 females. Of these 38 swarming sites, 18 were composed exclusively of An. gambiae coluzzii and 20 exclusively of An. melas, presenting clear evidence of reproductive swarm segregation. The species makeup of couples sampled from swarms also demonstrated assortative mating. The swarm site localization was close to human dwellings in the case of the An. gambiae coluzzii and on salt production sites for An. melas. At the peak of the rainy season, swarms of An. melas were absent. These findings offer evidence that the ecological speciation of these two sibling species of mosquitoes is associated with spatial swarm segregation and assortative mating, providing strong support for the hypothesis that mate recognition is currently maintaining adaptive differentiation and promoting ecological speciation. Further studies on the swarming and mating systems of An. gambiae, with the prospect of producing a predictive model of swarm distribution, are needed to inform any future efforts to implement strategies based on the use of GMM or SIT.},

  abstract = {Collective behaviour is a widespread phenomenon in biology, cutting through a huge span of scales, from cell colonies up to bird flocks and fish schools. The most prominent trait of collective behaviour is the emergence of global order: individuals synchronize their states, giving the stunning impression that the group behaves as one. In many biological systems, though, it is unclear whether global order is present. A paradigmatic case is that of insect swarms, whose erratic movements seem to suggest that group formation is a mere epiphenomenon of the independent interaction of each individual with an external landmark. In these cases, whether or not the group behaves truly collectively is debated. Here, we experimentally study swarms of midges in the field and measure how much the change of direction of one midge affects that of other individuals. We discover that, despite the lack of collective order, swarms display very strong correlations, totally incompatible with models of non-interacting particles. We find that correlation increases sharply with the swarm's density, indicating that the interaction between midges is based on a metric perception mechanism. By means of numerical simulations we demonstrate that such growing correlation is typical of a system close to an ordering transition. Our findings suggest that correlation, rather than order, is the true hallmark of collective behaviour in biological systems.},

However, doing so requires entomological training and time-consuming manual effort. Here, we design computer vision techniques to determine stages in the gonotrophic cycle of female mosquitoes from images. Our dataset was collected from 139 adult female mosquitoes across three medically important species---               Aedes aegypti               ,               Anopheles stephensi               , and               Culex quinquefasciatus               ---and all four gonotrophic stages of the cycle (unfed, fully fed, semi-gravid, and gravid). From these mosquitoes and stages, a total of 1959 images were captured on a plain background via multiple smartphones. Subsequently, we trained four distinct AI model architectures (               ResNet50               ,               MobileNetV2               ,               EfficientNet-B0               , and               ConvNeXtTiny               ), validated them using unseen data, and compared their overall classification accuracies. Additionally, we analyzed t-SNE plots to visualize the formation of decision boundaries in a lower-dimensional space. Notably,               ResNet50               and               EfficientNet-B0               demonstrated outstanding performance with an overall accuracy of 97.44\% and 93.59\%, respectively.               EfficientNet-B0               demonstrated the best overall performance considering computational efficiency, model size, training speed, and t-SNE decision boundaries. We also assessed the explainability of this               EfficientNet-B0               model, by implementing Grad-CAMs---a technique that highlights pixels in an image that were prioritized for classification. We observed that the highest weight was for those pixels representing the mosquito abdomen, demonstrating that our AI model has indeed learned correctly. Our work has significant practical impact. First, image datasets for gonotrophic stages of mosquitoes are not yet available. Second, our algorithms can be integrated with existing citizen science platforms that enable the public to record and upload biological observations. With such integration, our algorithms will enable the public to contribute to mosquito surveillance and gonotrophic stage identification. Finally, we are aware of work today that uses computer vision techniques for automated mosquito species identification, and our algorithms in this paper can augment these efforts by enabling the automated detection of gonotrophic stages of mosquitoes as well.},

(Diptera: Culicidae) mating occurs during swarming, but knowledge of their mating behavior under natural conditions is limited. Mosquitoes mate in flight over specific landmarks, known as swarm markers, at particular locations. Swarms consist of males; the females usually approach the swarm and depart following copulation. The number of mating pairs per swarm is closely associated with swarm size.The shape and height of swarm markers vary and may depend on the environmental conditions at the swarm's location. Male--male interactions in mosquito swarms with similar levels of attractive flight activity can offer a mating advantage to some individuals. Flight tone is used by mosquitoes to recognize the other sex and choose a desirable mate. Clarifying these and other aspects of mosquito reproductive behavior can facilitate the development of population control measures that target swarming sites.This review describes what is currently known about swarming behavior in Anopheles gambiae s.l., including swarm characteristics; mating within and outside of swarms, insemination in females, and factors affecting and stimulating swarming.},

The reproductive success of these mosquitoes relies on a single copulation event after which the majority of females become permanently refractory to further mating. This refractory behavior is at least partially mediated by the male-synthetized steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), which is packaged together with other seminal secretions into a gelatinous mating plug and transferred to the female atrium during mating. In this study, we show that two 20E-regulated chymotrypsin-like serine proteases specifically expressed in the reproductive tract of               An. gambiae               females play an important role in modulating the female susceptibility to mating. Silencing these proteases by RNA interference impairs correct plug processing and slows down the release of the steroid hormone 20E from the mating plug. In turn, depleting one of these proteases, the Mating Regulated Atrial Protease 1 (MatRAP1), reduces female refractoriness to further copulation, so that a significant proportion of females mate again. Microscopy analysis reveals that MatRAP1 is localized on a previously undetected peritrophic matrix-like structure surrounding the mating plug. These data provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms shaping the post-mating biology of these important malaria vectors.},

Diapause is widespread among insects and plays a key role in enhancing overwinter survival as well as defining the seasonal and geographic distributions of populations. Next-generation sequencing has greatly advanced our understanding of the transcriptional basis for this crucial adaptation but less is known about the regulation of embryonic diapause physiology at the metabolite level. Here, we characterized the lipid and metabolite profiles of embryonic diapause in the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus. We used an untargeted approach to capture the relative abundance of 250 lipids and 241 metabolites. We observed adjustments associated with increased energy storage, including an accumulation of lipids, the formation of larger lipid droplets and increased lipogenesis, as well as metabolite shifts suggesting reduced energy utilization. We also found changes in neuroregulatory- and insulin-associated metabolites with potential roles in diapause regulation. Finally, we detected a group of unidentified, diapause-specific metabolites which have physical properties similar to those of steroids/steroid derivatives and may be associated with the ecdysteroidal regulation of embryonic diapause in A. albopictus. Together, these results deepen our understanding of the metabolic regulation of embryonic diapause and identify key targets for future investigations.},

As               Anopheles               mosquitos are nocturnal, we investigated whether their salivary glands are under circadian control, anticipating bloodmeals and modulating parasite biology for host encounters. Here we show that approximately half of the mosquito salivary gland transcriptome, particularly genes essential for efficient bloodmeals such as anti-blood clotting factors, exhibits circadian expression. Furthermore, measuring haemoglobin levels, we demonstrate that mosquitos prefer to feed and ingest more blood at nighttime. Notably, we show a substantial subset of the salivary-gland-resident parasite transcriptome cycling throughout the day, indicating that this stage is not transcriptionally quiescent. Among the sporozoite genes undergoing rhythmic expression are those involved in parasite motility, potentially modulating the ability to initiate infection at different times of day. Our findings suggest a circadian tripartite relationship between the vector, parasite and mammalian host that together modulates malaria transmission.},

New approaches to malaria vector control are being explored including population suppression through swarm reductions and genetic modification involving gene drives. Designing and evaluating these new interventions require good understanding of the biology of the target vectors.                 Anopheles                 mosquito swarms have historically been hard to locate in Uganda and therefore have remained poorly characterized. In this study we sought to identify and characterize                 An. gambiae                 s.l mosquito swarms in three study sites of high                 An. gambiae                 s.l prevalence within Central Uganda.                                                        Methods               Nine sampling visits were made to three villages over a 2-year period. Sampling targeted both wet and dry seasons and was done for 2 days per village during each trip, using sweep nets. All swarm data were analysed using the JMP 14 software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA), parametrically or non-parametrically as appropriate.                                         Results                                Most of the                 An. gambiae                 s.s. swarms sampled during this study were single-species swarms. However, some mixed                 An. gambiae                 s.s. and                 Culex                 spp. mosquito swarms were also observed. Swarms were larger in the wet season than in the dry season. Mean swarm height ranged from 2.16 m to 3.13~m off the ground and only varied between villages but not by season.                 Anopheles gambiae                 mosquitoes were present in all three villages, preferred to swarm over bare ground markers, and could be effectively sampled by field samplers.                                                        Conclusions                                This study demonstrated that                 An. gambiae                 s.l swarms could be effectively located and sampled in South Central Uganda and provided in-depth descriptions of hitherto poorly understood aspects of                 An. gambiae                 local swarm characteristics. Swarms were found close to inhabited households and were greater in size and number during the rainy season.                 Anopheles gambiae                 s.s swarms were significantly associated with bare ground markers and were sometimes at heights over 4~m above the ground, showing a necessity to develop tools suitable for swarm sampling at these heights. While mixed species swarms have been reported before elsewhere, this is the first documented instance of mixed genus swarms found in Uganda and should be studied further as it could have implications for swarm sampling explorations where multiple species of mosquitoes exist.

The active US plays a secondary role to the downstroke (DS), generating both thrust and negative vertical force. However, whether their active halfstroke function is fixed or facultative has not been clarified. We showed that during multiple backward flights of an individual, postural adjustments via body angles greater than 90{$^\circ$}, with pitch-down and pitch-up motions in the DS and US, respectively, reoriented the stroke plane and caused the reversal of the aerodynamic functions of the halfstrokes compared with forward flight. The US and DS primarily provided weight support and horizontal force, respectively, and a leading edge vortex (LEV) was formed in both halfstrokes. The US's LEV was a Class II LEV extending from wingtip to wingtip, previously reported albeit during the DS in forward flight. The US's net force contribution increased from 32\% in forward to 60\% in backward flight. Likewise, US weight support increased from 8 to 85\%. Despite different trajectories, body postures and force orientations among flight sequences in the global frame, the halfstroke-average forces pointed in a uniform direction relative to the body in both forward and backward flight.},

The development and deployment of effective and efficient mosquito control products and strategies require a profound understanding of mosquito behaviour. To study complex mosquito behaviour, automated video tracking of mosquito flight paths has proven to be a comprehensive approach, and several video tracking approaches have emerged in recent years, making the choice for a suitable system challenging. Here, we conducted a literature review by searching PubMed and Google Scholar, and we identified 66 publications focusing on mosquito video tracking, which made use of eight different systems. We then compared and scored those video tracking systems by assessing their performance in the laboratory as well as their potential suitability for tracking mosquito behaviour in a field setting. While all eight systems have produced valuable information on mosquito behaviour, for tracking mosquitoes in the field, 'Braid', 'EthoVision XT' and 'Trackit3D' appear to be the most suitable systems as they need small disk capacity and are well adaptable to different settings. However, the optimal choice will ultimately depend on the specifications required to answer a given research question, the financial resources available and user preferences.},

Males of the 4 species showed flight tones considerably higher than females. Up to 7 harmonics were measured for each species. Close correspondence for each individual mosquito of the means of the flight tone harmonics (corrected for harmonic number) demonstrated the accuracy and precision of the method. These data indicate that flight tone differences have been subjected to selection and may act as an isolating mechanism for mating or serve some other behavioral purpose in these mosquitoes.

  abstract = {Despite their prevalence in nature, the evolution of sex-specific female ornaments is still not well understood. Although in some cases (often carotenoid-based ornaments) they appear to honestly signal quality, such as fecundity, it has been suggested that some female ornaments evolved to deceptively obtain matings. One such case is the long-tailed dance fly (Rhamphomyia longicauda) where females possess two sex-specific ornaments: pinnate scales on the hind femur and tibia and abdominal sacs that are inflated in female-biased ``display'' swarms. Because females rely on male nuptial food gifts to initiate and sustain egg development, female ornaments are thought to have evolved in the context of deceiving males to obtain gifts. For males, the costs of being deceived may be reduced if female ornaments on average provide valuable information about female quality such as fecundity to males. Here, we use static allometry (with body size as a proxy for condition) of both ornamental and non-ornamental traits in females (and homologous non-ornamental traits in males) in order to determine whether they indicate condition to males. Most male traits scaled isometrically with body size, however, as often expected for sexually selected traits, female ornaments (abdomen area and tibia scale length) showed significant positive allometry and had steep slopes relative to non-ornamental traits. In addition, male leg hairs (homologous with female scales) showed positive static allometry, probably because they are involved in nuptial-prey capture or in grasping mates. As larger females invest more in ornamentation relative to smaller females, their ornaments may exaggerate differences in female condition and thus inform male mating decisions.},

  abstract = {Mosquitoes and sandflies exhibit a wide range of blood feeding patterns, targeting a wide range of vertebrate species, including birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians, for proteins vital for egg development. This broad host range increases the opportunity for them to acquire pathogens of numerous debilitating-and-fatal diseases from various animal reservoirs, playing a significant role in disease crossover between animals and humans, also known as zoonotic transmission. This review focuses on the intricate blood-feeding habits of these dipteran vectors, their sensory systems and the complex dance between host and pathogen during disease transmission. We delve into the influence of blood sources on pathogen spread by examining the insect immune response and its intricate interplay with pathogens. The remarkable sense of smell guiding them towards food sources and hosts is explored, highlighting the interplay of multiple sensory cues in their navigation. Finally, we examine the challenges in mosquito control strategies and explore innovations in this field, emphasizing the need for sustainable solutions to combat this global health threat. By understanding the biology and behaviour of these insects, we can develop more effective strategies to protect ourselves and mitigate the burden of vector-borne diseases.},

  abstract = {In mammals, the so-called ``seat of the cognitive map'' is located in place cells within the hippocampus. Recent work suggests that the shape of place cell fields might be defined by the animals' natural movement; in rats the fields appear to be laterally compressed (meaning that the spatial map of the animal is more highly resolved in the horizontal dimensions than in the vertical), whereas the place cell fields of bats are statistically spherical (which should result in a spatial map that is equally resolved in all three dimensions). It follows that navigational error should be equal in the horizontal and vertical dimensions in animals that travel freely through volumes, whereas in surfacebound animals would demonstrate greater vertical error. Here, we describe behavioral experiments on pelagic fish in which we investigated the way that fish encode threedimensional space and we make inferences about the underlying processing. Our work suggests that fish, like mammals, have a higher order representation of space that assembles incoming sensory information into a neural unit that can be used to determine position and heading in three-dimensions. Further, our results are consistent with this representation being encoded isotropically, as would be expected for animals that move freely through volumes. Definitive evidence for spherical place fields in fish will not only reveal the neural correlates of space to be a deep seated vertebrate trait, but will also help address the questions of the degree to which environment spatial ecology has shaped cognitive processes and their underlying neural mechanisms.},

We compare sexual selection in male and female dance flies, Rhamphomyia longicauda (Diptera: Empididae). Swarming females display size-enhancing abdominal sacs, enlarged wings and decorated tibiae, and compete for nuptial gifts provided by males. Males preferentially approach large females, but the nature of selection and whether it is sex-specific are unknown. We found contrasting sexual selection for mating success on structures shared by males and females. In females, long wings and short tibiae were favoured, whereas males with short wings and long tibiae had a mating advantage. There was no assortative mating. Females occupying potentially advantageous swarm positions were large and, in contrast to selection for mating success, tended to have larger tibiae than those of rivals. We discuss our findings in the context of both the mating biology of dance flies, and the evolution of sexual dimorphism in general.},

  abstract = {An important element of mating in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae Giles in nature is the crepuscular mating aggregation (swarm) composed almost entirely of males, where most coupling and insemination is generally believed to occur. In this study, we mathematically characterize the oscillatory movement of male An. gambiae in terms of an established individual-based mechanistic model that parameterizes the attraction of a mosquito toward the center of the swarm using the natural frequency of oscillation and the resistance to its motion, characterized by the damping ratio. Using three-dimensional trajectory data of ten wild mosquito swarms {\TH}lmed in Mali, Africa, we show two new results for low and moderate wind conditions, and indicate how these results may vary in high wind. First, we show that in low and moderate wind the vertical component of the mosquito motion has a lower frequency of oscillation and higher damping ratio than horizontal motion. In high wind, the vertical and horizontal motions are similar to one another and the natural frequencies are higher than in low and moderate wind. Second, we show that the predicted average disagreement in the direction of motion of swarming mosquitoes moving randomly is greater than the average disagreement we observed between each mosquito and its three closest neighbors, with the smallest level of disagreement occurring for the nearest neighbor in seven out of 10 swarms. The alignment of the direction of motion between nearest neighbors is the highest in high wind. This result provides evidence for {\ss}ight-path coordination between swarming male mosquitoes.},

The tracking system is designed to address noisy, low frame-rate (25 frames per second) video streams from a stereo camera system.

We provide an adaptive algorithm to search for missing streaks and a likelihood function that uses streak endpoints to extract velocity information. A modified multi-hypothesis tracker probabilistically addresses occlusions and a particle filter estimates the trajectories. The output of the tracking algorithm is a set of track segments with an average length of 0.6--1 s. The segments are verified and combined under human supervision to create individual tracks up to the duration of the video (90 s). We evaluate tracking performance using an established metric for multi-target tracking and validate the accuracy using independent stereo measurements of a single swarm.

The swarm attracted both males and females and increased mating activity. The number of copulas per mosquito was positively correlated with the number of mosquitoes in the swarm and with the duration of the swarm. Swarming and mating activity increased with the presence of a host for females. Young sexually immature males, less than 24 h old, flew but did not swarm nor copulate. Observations using an olfactometer showed that swarming males produced a volatile pheromone that stimulates the flying activity of females at a distance. Females also produce a volatile attractant. The results suggest that males, and possibly also females, produce an aggregation pheromone that attracts males and females towards the swarm. The characteristics of the pheromone-mediated swarm may be described as a 3-dimensional lek. Our results suggest that the development of pheromone-based control systems and/or pheromone traps for the monitoring of vector populations is feasible, adding a new tool to combat this vector of several human pathogens.},

The development of new insecticides and insecticidal formulations is time consuming and costly, however. A more active crystalline form of deltamethrin, prepared by heating the commercial crystalline form, previously was reported to be 12-times faster acting against susceptible North American                 Anopheles quadrimaculatus                 mosquitoes. Herein the potential for heat-activated deltamethrin dispersed on chalk to overcome various resistance mechanisms amongst five West African                 Anopheles                 strains is investigated, and its long-term sustained lethality evaluated.                                                        Methods                                The more active deltamethrin form was generated in a commercial dust containing deltamethrin by heating the material as purchased. Tarsal contact bioassays were conducted to investigate its efficacy, potency, and speed of action against resistant                 Anopheles                 populations compared to the commercially available form of deltamethrin dust.                                                        Results               In all cases, D-Fense Dust heated to generate the more active form of deltamethrin was substantially more effective than the commercially available formulation. 100\% of both Banfora~M and Kisumu populations were knocked down 10~min post-exposure with no recovery afterwards. Gaoua-ara and Tiefora strains exhibited 100\% knockdown within 15~min, and the VK7 2014 strain exhibited 100\% knockdown within 20~min. In all cases, 100\% mortality was observed 24~h post-exposure. Conversely, the commercial formulation (unheated) resulted in less than 4\% mortality amongst VK7 2014, Banfora, and Gaoua-ara populations by 24~h, and Tiefora and Kisumu mosquitoes experienced 14 and 47\% mortality by 24~h, respectively. The heat-activated dust maintained comparable efficacy 13 months after heating.                                         Conclusions                                The heat-activated form of commercial deltamethrin D-Fense Dust outperformed the material as purchased, dramatically increasing efficacy against all tested pyrethroid-resistant strains. This increase in lethality was retained for 13 months of storage under ambient conditions in the laboratory. Higher energy forms of commonly used insecticides may be employed to overcome various resistance mechanisms seen in African                 Anopheles                 mosquitoes through more rapid uptake of insecticide molecules from their respective solid surfaces. That is, resistant mosquitoes can be killed with an insecticide to which they are resistant without altering the molecular composition of the insecticide.},

For the anopheline mosquitoes responsible for African malaria transmission, mating takes place within crepuscular male swarms which females enter solely to mate. However, the mechanisms that regulate swarm structure or that govern mate choice remain opaque. We used 3D-video tracking approaches and computer vision algorithms developed for the study of other complex biological systems to document swarming behavior of a lab-adapted               Anopheles gambiae               line in a lab-based setting. By reconstructing trajectories of individual mosquitoes lasting up to 15.88~s, in swarms containing upwards of 200 participants, we documented swarm-like behavior in both males and females. In single sex swarms, encounters between individuals were fleeting ({$<$}\,0.75~s). By contrast, in mixed swarms, we were able to detect 79 `brief encounters' ({$>$}\,0.75~s;\,{$<$}\,2.5~s) and 17 longer-lived encounters ({$>$}\,2.5~s). We also documented several examples of apparent male-male mating competition. These findings represent the first steps towards a more detailed and quantitative description of swarming and courtship behavior in one of the most important vectors of malaria.},

Naturally occurring swarms of               A.melas               were seen in a clearing at the edge of mangrove swamps close to their breeding sites. Males could be induced to swarm over artificial `markers' within this `arena' but not outside it. Females were observed entering the swarm and mating. In the laboratory, in an artificial `dusk', male               A.gambiae               s.str. swarmed over a black marker on the floor of their 1.2-m cube cage. In contrast to the males, females made only short flights over the marker, performing brief turning movements at its edge. It is proposed that swarming brings about the aggregation necessary before short-range attraction can take place, and that, in nature, anopheline mosquitoes orientate visually first to an arena and then to a marker within the arena. Female behaviour can be interpreted as a process of scanning possible swarm sites until mating is achieved.},

It is suggested that species specific swarm sites act as the mate recognition system in anophelines and it is proposed that virgin females respond to the swarm site per se rather than the swarm itself. Given the high operational sex ratio and the inability of any male to dominate all females within the swarm, it is considered that chance, rather than sexual selection, is the most important determinant of mating. The male being in the swarm may be a sufficiently strong signal to the female of his fitness, so that more elaborate sexual selection is unnecessary.The possibility of alternative mechanisms for mating may also exist but need to be investigated further. Given the importance of swarms as the isolating mechanism between species, emphasis should be placed on determining the characteristics of swarm sites and markers between them.},

Males swarmed 2 - 3 m above markers of horizontal contrast such as those formed between grass areas and footpaths, or bushes. Evening swarms started 2 min before sunset in sheltered sites and a minute or two later in exposed ones. It took approximately 5 mins from the arrival of the first male for the swarm to reach estimated maximum numbers. Mating pairs were first seen 7 min after the start of swarming. Maximum numbers of pairs in copula were observed 8 min later. Up to 270 pairings were seen in the 20 min period before darkness. Removal of males had no effect on the number of females arriving at the swarm. Males were attracted to sounds that approximated the female flight tone but not to filter paper samples of squashed virgin females swung through the swarm.

Given this, the last sixty years have seen many research efforts devoted to this task. To date, however, none of this research has had a lasting impact. In this work, we show that pseudo-acoustic optical sensors can produce superior data; that additional features, both intrinsic and extrinsic to the insect's flight behavior, can be exploited to improve insect classification; that a Bayesian classification approach allows to efficiently learn classification models that are very robust to over-fitting, and a general classification framework allows to easily incorporate arbitrary number of features. We demonstrate the findings with large-scale experiments that dwarf all previous works combined, as measured by the number of insects and the number of species considered.},

  abstract = {More than a million insects and approximately 11,000 vertebrates utilize flapping wings to fly. However, flapping flight has only been studied in a few of these species, so many challenges remain in understanding this form of locomotion. Five key aerodynamic mechanisms have been identified for insect flight. Among these is the leading edge vortex, which is a convergent solution to avoid stall for insects, bats and birds. The roles of the other mechanisms --added mass, clap and fling, rotational circulation and wing--wake interactions -- have not yet been thoroughly studied in the context of vertebrate flight. Further challenges to understanding bat and bird flight are posed by the complex, dynamic wing morphologies of these species and the more turbulent airflow generated by their wings compared with that observed during insect flight. Nevertheless, three dimensionless numbers that combine key flow, morphological and kinematic parameters -- the Reynolds number, Rossby number and advance ratio -- govern flapping wing aerodynamics for both insects and vertebrates. These numbers can thus be used to organize an integrative framework for studying and comparing animal flapping flight. Here, we provide a roadmap for developing such a framework, highlighting the aerodynamic mechanisms that remain to be quantified and compared across species. Ultimately, incorporating complex flight maneuvers, environmental effects and developmental stages into this framework will also be essential to advancing our understanding of the biomechanics, movement ecology and evolution of animal flight.},

We review publications on butterfly migration published in six languages (English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish), summarise how migration in butterflies has been studied, explore geographic and taxonomic patterns in the knowledge base, and outline key future research directions. Using English search keywords, we found only 58 studies from Asia; however, after searching in local languages, we found an additional 98 relevant studies. Overall, butterfly migration studies are mostly from North America and Europe. Most studies focus on three species: monarch (Danaus plexippus), painted lady (Vanessa cardui) and red admiral (Vanessa atalanta). About 62\% of publications are focused on the monarch, with nearly 50\% of migratory butterfly species mentioned in only a single paper. Several research methods have been applied to ascribe migratory status and to study the physiology, neurobiology, and ecology of migration; however, virtually all this research is on a handful of species. There remain hundreds of species for which we do not understand the comprehensive seasonal pattern of movement, flight destinations, wintering, or breeding grounds. A better understanding of movement ecology and migratory connectivity is needed to effectively conserve migratory butterflies. It is essential that research becomes more geographically and linguistically representative since migrants frequently cross political borders and international cooperation is necessary for their conservation.},

Insect cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are potential examples of such dual traits. They form a waxy layer on the cuticle of the insect to maintain water balance and prevent desiccation, while also acting as signaling molecules in mate recognition and chemical communication. Because the synthesis of these hydrocarbons in insect oenocytes occurs through a common biochemical pathway, natural or sexual selection on one role may affect the other. In this review, we explore how ecological divergence in insect CHCs can lead to divergence in mating signals and reproductive isolation. We suggest that the evolution of insect CHCs may be ripe models for understanding ecological speciation.},

Environmental factors such as diet, relative humidity or exposure to insecticides also affect the CHC composition in mosquitoes. In this work, the CHC profile was analyzed in two               Anopheles albimanus               phenotypes with different degrees of susceptibility to               Plasmodium               , the susceptible-White and resistant-Brown phenotypes, in response to the two dietary regimes of mosquitoes: a carbon-rich diet (sugar) and a protein-rich diet (blood) alone or containing               Plasmodium               ookinetes. The CHCs were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry or flame ionization detection, identifying 19 CHCs with chain lengths ranging from 20 to 37 carbons. Qualitative and quantitative changes in CHCs composition were dependent on diet, a parasite challenge, and, to a lesser extent, the phenotype. Blood-feeding caused up to a 40\% reduction in the total CHC content compared to sugar-feeding. If blood contained ookinetes, further changes in the CHC profile were observed depending on the               Plasmodium               susceptibility of the phenotypes. Higher infection prevalence caused greater changes in the CHC profile. These dietary and infection-associated modifications in the CHCs could have multiple effects on mosquito fitness, impacts on disease transmission, and tolerance to insecticides.},

Most predators identified consume many other insect species and there is no evidence that any species preys exclusively on any anopheline mosquito. There is one predatory species with a specialisation on blood-fed mosquitoes including An. gambiae s.l.. Evarcha culicivora is a jumping spider, known as the vampire spider, found around Lake Victoria. There is no evidence that these salticids require Anopheles mosquitoes and will readily consume blood-fed Culex. Interspecific competition studies focus on other mosquitoes of larval habitats. Many of these take place in artificial cosms and give contrasting results to semi-field studies. This may limit their extrapolation regarding the potential impact of reduced An. gambiae numbers. Previous mosquito control interventions are informative and identify competitive release and niche opportunism; so while the identity and relative abundance of the species present may change, the biomass available to predators may not.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                        Aedes aegypti             , the yellow fever mosquito, presents a major threat to human health across the globe as a vector of disease-causing pathogens. Females of this species generally mate only once. From this single mating event, the female stores sufficient sperm to fertilize the multiple clutches of eggs produced during her lifetime. Mating causes dramatic changes in the female's behavior and physiology, including a lifetime suppression of her mating receptivity. Female rejection behaviors include male avoidance, abdominal twisting, wing-flicking, kicking, and not opening vaginal plates or extruding the ovipositor. Many of these events occur on a scale that is too miniscule or fast to see by eye, so high-resolution videography has been used to observe these behaviors instead. However, videography can be labor intensive, require specialized equipment, and often requires restrained animals. We used an efficient, low-cost method to record physical contact between males and females during attempted and successful mating, determined by recording spermathecal filling after dissection. A hydrophobic oil-based fluorescent dye can be applied to the abdominal tip of one animal and can be subsequently transferred to the genitalia of animals of the opposite sex when genital contact occurs. Our data indicate that male mosquitoes make high levels of contact with both receptive and unreceptive females and that males attempt to mate with more females than they successfully inseminate. Female mosquitoes with disrupted remating suppression mate with and produce offspring from multiple males, transferring dye to each. These data suggest that physical copulatory interactions occur independently of the female's receptivity to mate and that many of these interactions represent unsuccessful mating attempts that do not result in insemination.},

In these groups, neighbors exhibit strong mutual attraction, alignment, and collision avoidance. Here, we tested whether insect swarms arise from similar simple behavioral rules. Using high-speed videography and agent-based modeling, we identified the behavioral rules governing mating swarms of flying malaria mosquitoes, marking the first such analysis for any insect species. We found that, unlike birds and fish, mosquito swarming behavior is driven primarily by environmental cues like the sunset horizon and ground objects. In fact, interactions between conspecifics are limited to only close-range collision avoidance behaviors. Thus, insect swarming seems fundamentally distinct from bird flocking and fish schooling.},

  abstract = {Flying insects have evolved the ability to evade looming objects, such as predators and swatting hands. This is particularly relevant for blood-feeding insects, such as mosquitoes that routinely need to evade the defensive actions of their blood hosts. To minimize the chance of being swatted, a mosquito can use two distinct strategies---continuously exhibiting an unpredictable flight path or maximizing its escape maneuverability. We studied how baseline flight unpredictability and escape maneuverability affect the escape performance of day-active and night-active mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti and Anopheles coluzzii, respectively). We used a multi-camera high-speed videography system to track how freely flying mosquitoes respond to an event-triggered rapidly approaching mechanical swatter, in four different light conditions ranging from pitch darkness to overcast daylight. Results show that both species exhibit enhanced escape performance in their natural blood-feeding light condition (daylight for Aedes and dark for Anopheles). To achieve this, they show strikingly different behaviors. The enhanced escape performance of Anopheles at night is explained by their increased baseline unpredictable erratic flight behavior, whereas the increased escape performance of Aedes in overcast daylight is due to their enhanced escape maneuvers. This shows that both day and night-active mosquitoes modify their flight behavior in response to light intensity such that their escape performance is maximum in their natural blood-feeding light conditions, when these defensive actions by their blood hosts occur most. Because Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes are major vectors of several deadly human diseases, this knowledge can be used to optimize vector control methods for these specific species.},

By using odour blends and visual cues that attract anthropophilic mosquitoes, odour-baited traps have been developed to monitor and control human pathogen-transmitting vectors. Although long-range attraction of such traps has already been studied thoroughly, close-range response of mosquitoes to these traps has been largely ignored. Here, we studied the flight behaviour of female malaria mosquitoes (               Anopheles coluzzii               ) in the immediate vicinity of a commercially available odour-baited trap, positioned in a hanging and standing orientation. By analysing more than 2500 three-dimensional flight tracks, we elucidated how mosquitoes reacted to the trap, and how this led to capture. The measured flight dynamics revealed two distinct stereotypical behaviours: (i) mosquitoes that approached a trap tended to simultaneously fly downward towards the ground; (ii) mosquitoes that came close to a trap changed their flight direction by rapidly accelerating upward. The combination of these behaviours led to strikingly different flight patterns and capture dynamics, resulting in contrasting short-range attractiveness and capture mechanism of the oppositely oriented traps. These new insights may help in improving odour-baited traps, and consequently their contribution in global vector control strategies.},

  abstract = {Background: When seeking a human for a blood meal, mosquitoes use several cues to detect and find their hosts. From this knowledge, counter-flow odour-baited traps have been developed that use a combination of CO2, human-mimicking odour, visual cues and circulating airflow to attract and capture mosquitoes. Initially developed for monitoring, these traps are now also being considered as promising vector control tools. The traps are attractive to host-seeking mosquitoes, but their capture efficiency is low. It has been hypothesized that the lack of short-range host cues, such as heat and increased local humidity, often prevent mosquitoes from getting close enough to get caught; this lack might even trigger avoidance manoeuvres near the capture region. Methods: This study investigated how close-range host cues affect the flight behaviour of Anopheles female malaria mosquitoes around odour-baited traps, and how this affects trap capture performance. For this, a novel counter-flow odour-baited trap was developed, the M-Tego. In addition to the usual CO2 and odour-blend, this trap can provide the short-range host cues, heat and humidity. Systematically adding or removing these two cues tested how this affected the trap capture percentages and flight behaviour. First, capture percentages of the M-Tego with and without shortrange host cues to the BG-Suna trap were compared, in both laboratory and semi-field testing. Then, machine-vision techniques were used to track the three-dimensional flight movements of mosquitoes around the M-Tego. Results: With heat and humidity present, the M-Tego captured significantly more mosquitoes as capture percentages almost doubled. Comparing the flight behaviour around the M-Tego with variable close-range host cues showed that when these cues were present, flying mosquitoes were more attracted to the trap and spent more time there. In addition, the M-Tego was found to have a better capture mechanism than the BG-Suna, most likely because it does not elicit previously observed upward avoiding manoeuvres. Conclusions: Results suggest that adding heat and humidity to an odour-baited trap lures more mosquitoes close to the trap and retains them there longer, resulting in higher capture performance. These findings support the development of control tools for fighting mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria.},

Sex-role reversed courtship behavior, involving female swarming and male choice, appears to be correlated with certain female secondary sexual characters that are widespread throughout the Empidinae. The tendency to shift mate choice from females to males, and the apparent development of autogeny in many empidine species, are both hypothesized to have resulted from males monopolizing the proteinaceous food source of non-hunting females, through transfers of nuptial gifts of prey. The autogenous condition appears to have led to the ritualized presentation of various types of inedible nuptial gifts by males of several species, possibly including the development of secreted nuptial gifts, or balloons, as displays of male fitness.},

Although the habitats of these villages differ markedly, sympatric populations of M and S molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. occur in both places periodically. The main aim was to assess the degree to which these molecular forms mate assortatively. In Soumousso, a wooded savannah habitat, the majority of swarm samples consisted of only S-form males (21/28), although a few M-form males were found in mixed M- and S-form swarms. In VK7, a rice growing area, the majority of swarm samples consisted of only M-form males (38/62), until October and November 2006, when there were nearly as many mixed-form as single-form swarms. Overall, {$\sim$}60\% of M- and S-form swarms were temporally or spatially segregated; the two forms were effectively prevented from encountering each other. Of the remaining 40\% of swarms, however, only about half were single-form and the rest were mixed-form. Of the 33 copulae collected from mixed-form swarms, only four were mixed-form pairs, significantly fewer than expected by random pairing between forms ({$\chi$} 2 = 10.34, d.f. = 2, P {$<$} 0.01). Finally, all specimens of inseminated females were of the same form as the sperm contained within their spermatheca (n = 91), even for the four mixed-form copulae. These findings indicate that assortative mating occurs within mixed-form swarms, mediated most probably by close-range mate recognition cues.},

  abstract = {Mating causes dramatic changes in female physiology, behaviour, and immunity in many insects, inducing oogenesis, oviposition, and refractoriness to further mating. Females from the Anopheles gambiae species complex typically mate only once in their lifetime during which they receive sperm and seminal fluid proteins as well as a mating plug that contains the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone. This hormone, which is also induced by bloodfeeding, plays a major role in activating vitellogenesis for egg production. Here we show that female Anopheles coluzzii susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum infection is significantly higher in mated females compared to virgins. We also find that mating status has a major impact on the midgut transcriptome, detectable only under sugar-fed conditions: once females have blood-fed, the transcriptional changes that are induced by mating are likely masked by the widespread effects of blood-feeding on gene expression. To determine whether increased susceptibility to parasites could be driven by the additional 20E that mated females receive from males, we mimicked mating by injecting virgin females with 20E, finding that these females are significantly more susceptible to human malaria parasites than virgin females injected with the control 20E carrier. Further RNAseq was carried out to examine whether the genes that change upon 20E injection in the midgut are similar to those that change upon mating. We find that 79 midgut-expressed genes are regulated in common by both mating and 20E, and 96\% (n = 76) of these are regulated in the same direction (up vs down in 20E/mated). Together, these findings show that male Anopheles mosquitoes induce changes in the female midgut that can affect female susceptibility to P. falciparum. This implies that in nature, males might contribute to malaria transmission in previously unappreciated ways, and that vector control strategies that target males may have additional benefits towards reducing transmission.},

Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are disease vectors that evaluate and select freshwater habitats as oviposition sites. This behavior has both ecological and epidemiological implications. However, it is unknown how ALAN affects mosquito oviposition. We compared oviposition rates in outdoor mesocosms exposed to light-emitting diodes (LED, 3000\,K, ca. 13 lux) with dark controls. We assayed the oviposition behavior of natural populations of mosquitoes by quantifying mosquito eggs (               Culex restuans               Theobald and               Ochlerotatus japonicus               Theobald) deposited in the experimental mesocosms over 7\,days.

They impose a huge health burden on human populations spreading parasites as disparate as protozoans (malaria), viruses (yellow fever and more) and nematodes (filariasis) that cause life-threatening conditions. In recent years, mating has been proposed as a putative target for population control. Mosquitoes mate mid-air, in swarms initiated by males and triggered by a combination of internal and external stimuli. As the number of females in a swarm is limited, there is intense competition among males, and they `retune' their physiology for this demanding behaviour. There is limited knowledge on the `genetic reprogramming' required to enable swarming. Interestingly, recent evidence indicates that the upregulation of circadian clock genes may be involved in the swarming of malaria mosquitoes of the genus               Anopheles               . Here, we use whole-head RNA-seq to identify gene expression changes in               Aedes aegypti               males that are engaged in swarming in a laboratory setting. Our results suggest that in preparation to swarming, males tend to lower some housekeeping functions while increasing remodelling of the cytoskeleton and neuronal connectivity; the transcription of circadian clock genes is unaffected.},

Results: We found substantial variation in swarm size and in mating success between swarms. A strong correlation between swarm size and mating success was observed, and consistent with the hotspot model of lek formation, the per capita mating success of individual males did not increase with swarm size. For the spatial distribution of swarms, our results revealed that some display sites were more attractive to both males and females and that females were more attracted to large swarms. While the swarm markers we recognize help us in localizing swarms, they did not account for the variation in swarm size or in the swarm mating success, suggesting that mosquitoes probably are attracted to these markers, but also perceive and respond to other aspects of the swarming site. Conclusions: Characterizing the mating system of a species helps understand how this species has evolved and how selective pressures operate on male and female traits. The current study looked at male mating success of An. gambiae and discussed possible factors that account for its variation. We found that swarms of An. gambiae conform to the hotspot model of lek formation. But because swarms may lack the female choice component, we propose that the An. gambiae mating system is a lek-like system that incorporates characteristics pertaining to other mating systems such as scramble mating competition.},

  abstract = {Anopheles gambiae               , the major malaria vector in Africa, can be divided into two subgroups based on genetic and ecological criteria. These two subgroups, termed the M and S molecular forms, are believed to be incipient species. Although they display differences in the ecological niches they occupy in the field, they are often sympatric and readily hybridize in the laboratory to produce viable and fertile offspring. Evidence for assortative mating in the field was recently reported, but the underlying mechanisms awaited discovery. We studied swarming behaviour of the molecular forms and investigated the role of swarm segregation in mediating assortative mating. Molecular identification of 1145 males collected from 68 swarms in Don{\'e}gu{\'e}bougou, Mali, over 2 years revealed a strict pattern of spatial segregation, resulting in almost exclusively monotypic swarms with respect to molecular form. We found evidence of clustering of swarms composed of individuals of a single molecular form within the village. Tethered M and S females were introduced into natural swarms of the M form to verify the existence of possible mate recognition operating within-swarm. Both M and S females were inseminated regardless of their form under these conditions, suggesting no within-mate recognition. We argue that our results provide evidence that swarm spatial segregation strongly contributes to reproductive isolation between the molecular forms in Mali. However this does not exclude the possibility of additional mate recognition operating across the range distribution of the forms. We discuss the importance of spatial segregation in the context of possible geographic variation in mechanisms of reproductive isolation.},

These, together with the combined drug administration efforts to control malaria, have reduced the death toll to less than 700,000 deaths/year. This progress has engendered real excitement but the emergence and spread of insecticide resistance is challenging our ability to sustain and consolidate the substantial gains that have been made. Research is required to discover novel vector control tools that can supplement and improve the effectiveness of those currently available. Here, we argue that recent and continuing progress in our understanding of male mating biology is instrumental in the implementation of new approaches based on the release of either conventional sterile or genetically engineered males. Importantly, further knowledge of male biology could also lead to the development of new interventions, such as sound traps and male mass killing in swarms, and contribute to new population sampling tools. We review and discuss recent advances in the behavioural ecology of male mating with an emphasis on the potential applications that can be derived from such knowledge. We also highlight those aspects of male mating ecology that urgently require additional study in the future.},

  abstract = {Cuticular hydrocarbons are present on the surface of all insects and play an important role in the life of insects. Although primarily anti-desiccation agents, cuticular hydrocarbons are emerging as important chemicals in insect communication. Here we discuss the usefulness of hydrocarbons both as waterproofing and signalling compounds. The three major groups of hydrocarbons, i.e., n-alkanes, alkenes and methyl branched hydrocarbons, are discussed in detail. The biosynthesis of these cuticular hydrocarbons is briefly outlined as well as the role of cuticular hydrocarbons in taxonomy. In many nonhymenoptera insect studies, a simpler cuticular hydrocarbon profile has allowed researchers to identify the role of certain compounds, and the various functions of these are not spread evenly across the various groups of hydrocarbons. Due to the general complexity of many insect cuticular hydrocarbon profiles, which can contain upwards of 100 compounds, comparisons between groups are normally based on the entire profile using multi-variant statistical methods. Here, we highlight potential problems with the detection and analysis of cuticular hydrocarbons. By drawing information across a wide spectrum of studies it appears clear that the main role of the n-alkanes is to control transcuticular water movement while the unsaturated compounds and methyl-branched hydrocarbons are more likely to be involved in communication. If future studies can concentrate on determining initially which groups of cuticular hydrocarbons are of interest, it would help narrow down the search for the exact role of hydrocarbons in insect societies. This comprehensive introduction to cuticular hydrocarbons is aimed at the rapidly increasing number of scientists, especially biologists, who are studying the role of cuticular hydrocarbons in insect behaviour.},

  abstract = {Background: Species in the Anopheles farauti complex are major malaria vectors in the Asia Pacific region. Anopheline mosquitoes exhibit circadian and diel rhythms in sugar- and blood-feeding (biting), flight activity, oviposition, and in some species, a short-lived dusk/early night associated swarming behaviour during which mating occurs. A behavioural study of wild-caught mosquitoes from Queensland, Australia was conducted to investigate the differences in diel rhythmic flight activity between two cryptic species in several reproductive states. Results: The 24-hour flight activity of individual adult female mosquitoes under light:dark cycle conditions were monitored with a minute-to-minute time resolution using an infrared beam break method. Mosquitoes were analyzed for reproductive state (insemination and parity) and identified to species [An. farauti (s.s.) Laveran and An. hinesorum Schmidt] by PCR analysis. We compared daily total flight activity, timing of activity onset, the peak in early nocturnal activity, and patterns of activity during the scotophase (night). Species-specific differences between An. farauti and An. hinesorum were observed. Compared to An. farauti, An. hinesorum had an earlier onset of dusk activity, an earlier peak in nocturnal activity, and a higher level of activity at the onset of darkness. Small differences between species were also observed in the pattern of the dusk/early-night bouts of activity. A second nocturnal peak in inseminated nulliparous An. hinesorum was also observed during the middle of the scotophase. Conclusions: The behavioural differences between these two sympatric species of the An. farauti complex might contribute to subtle differences in habitat adaptation, the timing of host-seeking and/or sugar-feeding activity. This study provides baseline data for analysis of populations of mosquitoes from other geographical regions where these species are malaria vectors, such as in the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. This is important as selective pressures due to long-term use of indoor residual spraying of insecticides and insecticide-treated bed nets are shifting the nocturnal profile of biting behaviour of these vectors to earlier in the night.},

Recent research indicates that a variety of insects rely extensively on learning for all major life activities including feeding, predator avoidance, aggression, social interactions, and sexual behavior. There is good evidence that individuals within an insect species exhibit genetically based variation in learning abilities and indirect evidence linking insect learning to fitness. Although insects rely on innate behavior to successfully manage many types of variation and unpredictability, learning may be superior to innate behavior when dealing with features unique to time, place, or individuals. Among insects, social learning , which can promote the rapid spread of novel behaviors, is currently known only from a few well-studied examples in social Hymenoptera. The prevalence and importance of social learning in insects are still unknown. Similarly, we know little about ecological factors that may have promoted enhanced learning abilities in insects, and whether learning has significantly contributed to speciation in insects.},

We investigated the distribution and population dynamics of these SRD and mitochondrial DNA variation in 16 populations from Europe and Japan. Confirming and extending results from the 1990s, we found that the SRD are present at variable frequencies in populations and that the               f               element is overall more frequent than               Wolbachia               . The two SRD never co-occur at high frequency in any population, suggesting an apparent mutual exclusion. We also detected               Wolbachia               or the               f               element in some males, which probably reflects insufficient titer to induce feminization or presence of masculinizing alleles.

  abstract = {Insects are one of the most successful classes on Earth, reflected in an enormous species richness and diversity. Arguably, this success is partly due to the high degree to which polyphenism, where one genotype gives rise to more than one phenotype, is exploited by many of its species. In social insects, for instance, larval diet influences the development into distinct castes; and locust polyphenism has tricked researchers for years into believing that the drastically different solitarious and gregarious phases might be different species. Solitarious locusts behave much as common grasshoppers. However, they are notorious for forming vast, devastating swarms upon crowding. These gregarious animals are shorter lived, less fecund and transmit their phase characteristics to their offspring. The behavioural gregarisation occurs within hours, yet the full display of gregarious characters takes several generations, as does the reversal to the solitarious phase. Hormones, neuropeptides and neurotransmitters influence some of the phase traits; however, none of the suggested mechanisms can account for all the observed differences, notably imprinting effects on longevity and fecundity. This is why, more recently, epigenetics has caught the interest of the polyphenism field. Accumulating evidence points towards a role for epigenetic regulation in locust phase polyphenism. This is corroborated in the economically important locust species Locusta migratoria and Schistocerca gregaria. Here, we review the key elements involved in phase transition in locusts and possible epigenetic regulation. We discuss the relative role of DNA methylation, histone modification and small RNA molecules, and suggest future research directions.},

Swarming is believed to be the primary behaviour during which mating occurs in the field, but is not a common behaviour in the laboratory. Features that stimulate male Anopheles gambiae G3 strain swarming were created in novel large indoor cages. Methods: The following visual features were tested in all combinations to determine which were important for swarm formation. Large cages and fading ceiling lights at dusk alone did not stimulate swarming while a dark foreground and contrasting illuminated background with a contrasting landmark stimulated and localized swarm formation during artificial twilight. Given the need to test transgenic strains in as natural a setting as possible, in this study it was investigated whether induced swarm behaviour and cage size would affect relative mating performance of wild-type and transgenic {$\beta$}2Ppo1 and {$\beta$}2Ppo2 A. gambiae sexually sterile males. Results: Even using a mosquito colony that has been in laboratory culture for 39 years, swarming behaviour was induced by this novel arrangement. The presence of swarming stimuli was associated with an increase in insemination frequency from 74.3 to 97.7\% in large cages. Transgenic males showed a lower competitiveness in large cages compared to small cages regardless of the presence of swarming stimuli. Conclusions: The results of the present study are discussed in view of the progressive evaluation of genetically modified A. gambiae strains and the potential applications of reproducing swarms in controlled conditions to dissect the mating behaviour of this species and the mechanisms controlling it.},

  abstract = {Population control of the dengue vector mosquito, Aedes aegypti, is difficult due to many reasons, one being the development of resistance to neurotoxic insecticides employed. The biosynthesis of chitin, a major constituent of insect cuticle, is a novel target for population control. Novaluron is a benzoylphenylurea (BPU) that acts as a chitin synthesis inhibitor, already used against mosquitoes. However, information regarding BPU effects on immature mosquito stages and physiological parameters related with mosquito larval development are scarce. A set of physiological parameters were recorded in control developing larvae and novaluron was administered continuously to Ae. aegypti larvae, since early third instar. Larval instar period duration was recorded from third instar until pupation. Chitin content was measured during third and fourth instars. Fourth instars were processed histochemically at the mesothorax region, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) for assessment of internal tissues, and labeled with WGA-FITC to reveal chitinized structures. In control larvae: i) there is a chitin content increase during both third and fourth instars where late third instars contain more chitin than early fourth instars; ii) thoracic organs and a continuous cuticle, closely associated with the underlying epidermis were observed; iii) chitin was continuously present throughout integument cuticle. Novaluron treatment inhibited adult emergence, induced immature mortality, altered adult sex ratio and caused delay in larval development. Moreover, novaluron: i) significantly affected chitin content during larval development; ii) induced a discontinuous and altered cuticle in some regions while epidermis was often thinner or missing; iii) rendered chitin cuticle presence discontinuous and less evident. In both control and novaluron larvae, chitin was present in the peritrophic matrix. This study showed quantitatively and qualitatively evidences of novaluron effects on Ae. aegypti larval development. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing histological alterations produced by a BPU in immature vector mosquitoes.},

In this study, we examined Aedes aegypti swarming behavior and identified associated chemical cues.

Isolation of Ae. aegypti aggregation pheromones was achieved by aeration of confined mosquitoes and collection of associated volatiles by glass filters. The collected volatiles were identified through gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS). Three aggregation pheromones were collected and identified as 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-ene-1,4-dione (ketoisophorone) (CAS\# 1125-21-9, tR = 18.75), 2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexane-1,4dione (the saturated analog of ketoisophorone) (CAS\# 20547-99-3, tR = 20.05), and 1-(4-ethylphenyl) ethanone (CAS\# 937-304, tR = 24.22). Our biological studies revealed that the identified compounds stimulated mosquito behavior under laboratory conditions. The mechanism of mosquito swarm formation is discussed in light of our behavioral study findings. A preliminary field trial demonstrated the potential application of the isolated aggregation pheromones in controlling Ae. aegypti. Journal of Vector Ecology 39 (2): 347-354. 2014.},

  abstract = {Anopheles gambiae complex mosquitoes comprise different morphologically identical species and the most medically important malaria vectors in Africa. Understanding An. gambiae complex mosquitoes' mating behaviour is a clue for prevention and control of malaria. The factors affecting the mating behavior of An. gambiae complex are age, body size, food finding, type of food, host availability and environmental temperature. An. gambiae complex passes through different and unique mating strategies. The fundamental mechanisms underlying mating behavior of An. gambiae complex are male aggregation before copulation which is called swarming, finding female and insemination. Male in the swarm detects the wing beat of female with which he mates by auditory system. The wing beat frequencies of opposite sex of the same genetic form simply harmonize indicating possible hybridization while that of different genetic forms do not harmonize. The successive mating behavior of female An. gambiae mosquitoes includes, locating a male among the swarm for cupola, friend selection and storage of sperm. Successful female An. gambiae complex mosquitoes mating is accomplished by host seeking, blood feeding and digestion, egg development and oviposition. The sequential process of host finding and blood feeding followed by blood digestion and simultaneously egg maturation and accomplished by searching of oviposition site and oviposition is referred to as gonotrophic cycle. The time period between two successive blood feedings or two successive ovipositions is said to be gonotrophic period. The length of gonotrophic period depends on temperature, number of previous gonotrophic cycle, host and breeding site availability. In addition to population net reproduction of the colony, gonotrophic cycle is also used to estimate female mosquitoes' age by determining the parity. Finally, understandings of mating behavior and gonotrophic cycle of An. gambiae complex mosquitoes help in malaria vector control strategies and their vector competence.},

  abstract = {Mosquitoes of many species mate in station-keeping swarms. Mating chases ensue as soon as a male detects the flight tones of a female with his auditory organs. Previous studies of hearing thresholds have mainly used electrophysiological methods that prevent the mosquito from flying naturally. The main aim of this study was to quantify behaviourally the sound level threshold at which males can hear females. Free-flying male Anopheles coluzzii were released in a large arena ({$\sim$}2 m high{\texttimes}2 m{\texttimes}1 m) with a conspicuous object on the ground that stimulated swarming behaviour. Males were exposed to a range of natural and synthetic played-back sounds of female flight. We monitored the responses of males and their distance to the speaker by recording changes in their wingbeat frequency and angular speed. We show that the mean male behavioural threshold of particle velocity hearing lies between 13 and 20 dB sound particle velocity level (SVL) (95\% confidence interval). A conservative estimate of 20 dB SVL (i.e. {$<$}0.5 {\textmu}m s-1 particle velocity) is 12--26 dB lower than most of the published electrophysiological measurements from the Johnston's organ. In addition, we suggest that (1) the first harmonic of a female's flight sound is sufficient for males to detect her presence, (2) males respond with a greater amplitude to singlefemale sounds than to the sound of a group of females and (3) the response of males to the playback of the flight sound of a live female is the same as to that of a recorded sound of constant frequency and amplitude.},

This is particularly true for ants living in obligate symbiosis with myrmecophytic plants. Here we present the first direct observations of the swarming event in the association between Crematogaster captiosa and the pioneer tree Macaranga bancana in Southeast Asia. Nuptial flights of C. captiosa on M. bancana took place during the night, and alate females were seen to copulate with alate males on the tree. Data on C. captiosa from the Malay Peninsula as well as Borneo indicate that sexual production and colony founding occurs throughout the year. Despite episodic fruiting seasons of the host plants, Macaranga saplings for colony founding can also become available outside peak seasons from seed banks after disturbance. Therefore, continuous swarming might be a good strategy to avoid strong competition for limited nesting sites while still securing permanent colonisation of saplings - a prerequisite for their survival.},

Larval development requires at least 2 years, but adults live only 2~weeks. The nonfeeding adults mate in swarms and females die shortly after oviposition. Eggs are suspended in a gel of unknown composition that is expressed from the female accessory gland. This project characterizes molecular mechanisms underlying reproduction in this midge by examining differential gene expression in whole males, females, and larvae, as well as in male and female accessory glands. Functional studies were used to assess the role of the gel encasing the eggs, as well as the impact of stress on reproductive biology. RNA-seq analyses revealed sex- and development-specific gene sets along with those associated with the accessory glands. Proteomic analyses were used to define the composition of the egg-containing gel, which is generated during multiple developmental stages and derived from both the accessory gland and other female organs. Functional studies indicate the gel provides a larval food source as well as a buffer for thermal and dehydration stress. All of these function are critical to juvenile survival. Larval dehydration stress directly reduces production of storage proteins and key accessory gland components, a feature that impacts adult reproductive success. Modeling reveals that bouts of dehydration may have a significant impact on population growth. This work lays a foundation for further examination of reproduction in midges and provides new information related to general reproduction in dipterans. A key aspect of this work is that reproduction and stress dynamics, currently understudied in polar organisms, are likely to prove critical in determining how climate change will alter their survivability.},

Therefore, a teacher needs to choose what to teach the students and how to approach them in an engaging and understandable way. In teaching programming, choosing the content and engaging students can be a challenge because the term programming is used in a variety of ways and contexts, which in turn demands different competencies. This paper uses the Didactical Triangle to discuss some challenges that arise when teaching programming on content, teacher, and student level. Some challenges arise from the structure of programming (syntax, interfaces, approaches, experience, and qualifications), while others are developed from the individual context of the learning situation (role of the teacher, students' motivation, expectations). While programming in computer science is relatively well described in the subject literature, programming in other professions is not well defined. Teaching computer programming in different courses can cause different challenges. Some situations of learning programming might be difficult for computer science students, while other situations might cause challenges for <<non-data>> students. This paper will present teachers' experiences combined with the theoretical view of challenges that arise when teaching programming in different study programs."},

Our group recruitment and cooperative transport algorithms provide the robots with the required swarm behavior. We conducted both simulations and experiments with real robot swarms, and analyzed the data statistically to investigate any changes caused by pheromone communication in the performance of the swarm in solving foraging recruitment and cooperative transport tasks. The results show that the robots can communicate using pheromone trails, and that the improvement due to pheromone communication may be non-linear, depending on the size of the robot swarm.},

  abstract = {Significance                            Anopheles gambiae               females are the principal vectors of malaria, a disease that kills more than 600,000 people every year. Current control methods using insecticides to kill mosquitoes are threatened by the spread of resistance in natural populations. A promising alternative control strategy is based on interfering with mosquito reproduction to reduce the number of malaria-transmitting females. Here we show that a male hormone transferred to the female during sex induces large changes in female behavior. These changes, defined as the postmating switch, include a physical incapacity for fertilization by additional males and the ability to lay mature eggs. Tampering with the function of this hormone generates unprecedented opportunities to reduce the reproductive success of               Anopheles               mosquitoes and impact malaria transmission.                        ,                             Female insects generally mate multiple times during their lives. A notable exception is the female malaria mosquito               Anopheles gambiae               , which after sex loses her susceptibility to further copulation. Sex in this species also renders females competent to lay eggs developed after blood feeding. Despite intense research efforts, the identity of the molecular triggers that cause the postmating switch in females, inducing a permanent refractoriness to further mating and triggering egg-laying, remains elusive. Here we show that the male-transferred steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) is a key regulator of monandry and oviposition in               An               .               gambiae               . When sexual transfer of 20E is impaired by partial inactivation of the hormone and inhibition of its biosynthesis in males, oviposition and refractoriness to further mating in the female are strongly reduced. Conversely, mimicking sexual delivery by injecting 20E into virgin females switches them to an artificial mated status, triggering egg-laying and reducing susceptibility to copulation. Sexual transfer of 20E appears to incapacitate females physically from receiving seminal fluids by a second male. Comparative analysis of microarray data from females after mating and after 20E treatment indicates that 20E-regulated molecular pathways likely are implicated in the postmating switch, including cytoskeleton and musculature-associated genes that may render the atrium impenetrable to additional mates. By revealing signals and pathways shaping key processes in the               An               .               gambiae               reproductive biology, our data offer new opportunities for the control of natural populations of malaria vectors.},

Although flight acoustics are essential to mosquito mating and present promising alternatives to insecticide-based vector control strategies, there is limited data on mosquito flight tones during swarming. Here, for the first time, we present detailed analyses of free-flying male and female               An. gambiae               flight tones and their harmonization (harmonic convergence) over a complete swarm sequence. Audio analysis of single-sex swarms showed synchronized elevation of male and female flight tones during swarming. Analysis of mixed-sex swarms revealed additional 50~Hz increases in male and female flight tones due to mating activity. Furthermore, harmonic differences between male and female swarm tones in mixed-sex swarms and in single-sex male swarms with artificial female swarm audio playback indicate that frequency differences of approximately 50~Hz or less at the male second and female third harmonics (M2:F3) are maintained both before and during mating interactions. This harmonization likely coordinates male scramble competition by maintaining ideal acoustic recognition within mating pairs while acoustically masking phonotactic responses of nearby swarming males to mating females. These findings advance our knowledge of mosquito swarm acoustics and provide vital information for reproductive control strategies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anopheles gambiae plant-sugar feeding was thought to be rare and physiologically optional. Unlike adult females, males have no alternative source of energy and soon die with only water, yet they might be competent to inseminate all females within their brief lifespan. This study was designed to detect sugar's effect, if any, on male performance. METHODS: Males with and without 20\% sucrose were evaluated at two body sizes and two temperatures, 23 degrees and 27 degrees C. Survival was recorded twice daily, and sexual behaviour was recorded each night after adult emergence. Insemination at a 2:1 male:female ratio was examined in three cage sizes, including walk-in mesocosms. RESULTS: Without sugar, males of both sizes lived longer at 23 degrees than 27 degrees C, and large males lived longer at each temperature. Survival of large males at low temperature averaged 3.7 days, small males at high temperature, 1.9 days. With sugar, males in all four treatments suffered minimal mortality. With sugar, in small cages, large males at 27 degrees C matured most rapidly. A few erected fibrillae and inseminated females on night 1. On night 2, maximal proportions erected fibrillae and swarmed, and over one-third of females became inseminated. Small sugar-fed males at 23 degrees C matured most slowly but had achieved nearly maximal levels of swarming by night 3. By night 5, small males had inseminated more than half the females, and large males had inseminated nearly all of them. Without sugar, large males progressed similarly during the first two nights. On night 3, however, the proportion erecting fibrillae and swarming declined precipitously at 27 degrees C, and to a lesser degree at 23 degrees C. Cumulative insemination never reached high levels. Small males never achieved high levels of fibrillar erection or swarming and inseminated few females, even at 23 degrees C. In larger cages and under more semi-natural conditions, regardless of body size, without sugar male insemination capacity was virtually nonexistent. CONCLUSION: Under some conditions, a limited number of sugar-deprived males can survive long enough to inseminate females. However, in nature males that cannot obtain sugar at frequent intervals will not be competitive with those that can, suggesting that male performance is closely tied to plant communities.},

Indeed, male malaria mosquitoes preferably respond to female flight tones during swarm time. This phenomenon implies a sophisticated context- and time-dependent modulation of mosquito audition, the mechanisms of which are largely unknown. Using transcriptomics, we identify a complex network of candidate neuromodulators regulating mosquito hearing in the species               Anopheles gambiae               . Among them, octopamine stands out as an auditory modulator during swarm time. In-depth analysis of octopamine auditory function shows that it affects the mosquito ear on multiple levels: it modulates the tuning and stiffness of the flagellar sound receiver and controls the erection of antennal fibrillae. We show that two {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-adrenergic-like octopamine receptors drive octopamine's auditory roles and demonstrate that the octopaminergic auditory control system can be targeted by insecticides. Our findings highlight octopamine as key for mosquito hearing and mating partner detection and as a potential novel target for mosquito control.},

Analysis of video recordings of               Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus               Say swarms showed that the overall swarming patterns of males and virgin females are similar, even though the short-term characteristics of their flight, such as speed and turning angle, differ. This suggests they have the same response to the visual cue of the swarm `marker'. The swarming pattern of an individual consists of elliptical loops which, in the short-term, define an area smaller than the swarm as a whole. The foci of these ellipses drift gradually with respect to the marker; individuals do not seem to have preferred positions within the swarm, but drift at random. Male mosquitoes identify and locate females by the sound of their wing-beats. Diffuse sound at the wing-beat frequency of female               C.p. quinquefasciatus               (500--600 Hz) caused males within the swarm to slow down significantly. Their turning behaviour remained unchanged, so the ellipses decreased in size. The swarm as a whole collapsed into a smaller volume, centred over the marker. Apparently, the response of males to sound consists of at least two parts: initially they alter their flight speed, and then alter their turning behaviour once they have located the source of the sound.},

Here, we present evidence for habitat segregation between the two molecular forms in and around irrigated rice fields located within the humid savannahs of western Burkina Faso. Longitudinal sampling of adult mosquitoes emerging from a range of breeding sites distributed along a transect extending from the heart of the rice field area into the surrounding savannah was conducted from June to November 2009. Analysis revealed that the two molecular forms and their sibling species               Anopheles arabiensis               are not randomly distributed in the area. A major ecological gradient was extracted in relation to the perimeter of the rice fields. The M form was associated with larger breeding sites mostly consisting of rice paddies, whereas the S form and               An. arabiensis               were found to depend upon temporary, rain-filled breeding sites. These results support hypotheses about larval habitat segregation and confirm the suggestion that the forms have different larval habitat requirements. Segregation appears to be clearly linked to anthropogenic permanent habitats and the community structure they support.},

The introduction of `tofo lamps', to divert chironomid midges from inhabited areas, has exploited the natural attraction that these insects have for artificial light. These tofo lamps had a high white light intensity (450 W) and were equipped with an external net that imitates the fish net, called `tofo'. The attractive efficiency of such lamps was tested in the summers of 2007, 2008 and 2009 by monitoring these devices in areas on eastern (S. Feliciano) and western (Castiglione del Lago) sides of Lake Trasimeno. The most attracted taxa included the species causing a serious nuisance, i.e. the large-sized Chironomus plumosus, and the small-sized Tanypus punctipennis and Procladius sp. In summer, massive swarms of the last two taxa preceded those of C. plumosus. Female chironomids were much more attracted than were males by the artificial white light, with a sex ratio much lower than 1. In addition, the percentage of gravid females of C. plumosus was higher than that of females not carrying eggs. Artificial lights were confirmed as effective in diverting the pestiferous chironomids, a feature that should be carefully considered in order to limit the nuisance from these insects and to avoid spreading insecticides in natural environments.},

Understanding how these modifications arise will inform us of how mosquitoes are responding to climate change and vector control interventions. CHCs are synthesised in sub-epidermal cells called oenocytes that are very difficult to isolate from surrounding tissues. Here we utilise a transgenic line with fluorescent oenocytes to purify these cells for the first time. Comparative transcriptomics revealed the enrichment of biological processes related to long chain fatty acyl-CoA biosynthesis and elongation of mono-, polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids and enabled us to delineate, and partially validate, the hydrocarbon biosynthetic pathway in An. gambiae.},

The successful execution of this collective phenomenon relies on the appropriate response of individuals in swarms to a myriad of signals that are produced by workers and queens to synchronize their nest exodus, subsequent house hunting, and eventual relocation to a new nest site. In this review, we describe our current understanding of the social factors that trigger swarming in colonies and the nonchemical and chemical signals that mediate a coordinated transition between its stages. We also highlight emerging work on the physiological and genomic mechanisms underpinning swarming behavior. Finally, we discuss the possible evolutionary origins of swarming behavior, through comparisons with related behaviors of migration, overwintering, estivation, and diapause in honey bees and other insects.},

  abstract = {Background Anopheles gambiae s.s. and An. coluzzii, two major malaria vectors in Africa, exist in the nature as two incipient, sympatric or allopatric species. In most of their sympatric areas, the reproductive isolation between these two distinct species is thought to be the main barrier to hybridization. However, in Senegal, barriers to the gene flow seems to be leaky in some areas with relatively higher than expected hybridization rates. Here, we characterized the swarming behavior of these two species to investigate its role in the observed high hybridization. Methods The study was carried out in the south and center of Senegal during the 2018 rainy season. Swarms were surveyed at sunset towards the lightest part of the sky, about 0.5--4 m above the ground. Once located, swarm were collected using a net. Indoor resting populations were also collected during the same period from each sentinel village by pyrethrum spray catch earlier the morning. All specimens collected were identified morphologically followed by PCR to estimate the frequency of the two species and female hybrids. Results Results showed that An. gambiae swarmed mainly over bare ground whereas An. coluzzii swarms over various objects forming a dark-light contrast with the ground. The height of swarms varied between 0.5 to 2.5 meters and the swarming duration was about 10 minutes. Start of swarming was mainly correlated with sunset and no mixed swarms were found in areas of sympatry despite the high level of hybridization rate (2.4\% - 4.4\%). Conclusion As found elsewhere in West Africa, swarming site segregation is an important pre-mating reproductive barrier between An. coluzzii and An. gambiae in Senegal. No link was found between swarming behavior and hybridization, but the lack of mixed swarms may be the result of low number of samples obtained in the sympatric area. Introduction Despite decades of control efforts, malaria remains a major public health problem worldwide. Indeed,},

Within predominantly female swarms, R. longicauda display structures in ight that are assessed by males. Structural and behavioural components of the display should increase the risk of predation on females. We found more females than males captured in spider webs.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Engineered sex ratio distorters (SRDs) have been proposed as a powerful component of genetic control strategies designed to suppress harmful insect pests. Two types of CRISPR-based SRD mechanisms have been proposed: X-shredding, which eliminates X-bearing sperm, and X-poisoning, which eliminates females inheriting disrupted X-chromosomes. These differences can have a profound impact on the population dynamics of SRDs when linked to the Y-chromosome: an X-shredder is invasive, constituting a classical meiotic Y-drive, whereas X-poisoning is self-limiting, unable to invade but also insulated from selection. Here, we establish X-poisoning strains in the malaria vector               Anopheles gambiae               targeting three X-linked genes during spermatogenesis, resulting in male bias. We find that sex distortion is primarily driven by a loss of X-bearing sperm, with limited evidence for postzygotic lethality of female progeny. By leveraging a               Drosophila melanogaster               model, we show unambiguously that engineered SRD traits can operate differently in these two insects. Unlike X-shredding, X-poisoning could theoretically operate at early stages of spermatogenesis. We therefore explore premeiotic Cas9 expression to target the mosquito X-chromosome. We find that, by pre-empting the onset of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation, this approach may enable the development of Y-linked SRDs if mutagenesis of spermatogenesis-essential genes is functionally balanced.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Land use change has increasingly been expanding throughout the world in the past decades. It can have profound effects on the spatial and temporal distribution of vector borne diseases like malaria through ecological and habitat change. Understanding malaria disease occurrence and the impact of prevention interventions under this intense environmental modification is important for effective and efficient malaria control strategy.                                         Methods               A descriptive ecological study was conducted by reviewing health service records at Abobo district health office. The records were reviewed to extract data on malaria morbidity, mortality, and prevention and control methods. Moreover, Meteorological data were obtained from Gambella region Meteorology Service Center and National Meteorology Authority head office. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis techniques were used to analyze the data.                                         Results                                For the twelve-year time period, the mean annual total malaria case count in the district was 7369.58. The peak monthly malaria incidence was about 57 cases per 1000 people. Only in 2009 and 2015 that zero death due to malaria was recorded over the past 12~years. Fluctuating pattern of impatient malaria cases occurrence was seen over the past twelve years with an average number of 225.5 inpatient cases. The data showed that there is a high burden of malaria in the district.                 Plasmodium falciparum                 (Pf) was a predominant parasite species in the district with the maximum percentage of about 90. There was no statistically significant association between season and total malaria case number (F                 3,8                 : 1.982, P:0.195). However, the inter-annual total case count difference was statistically significant (F                 11,132                 : 36.305,                 p                 \,{$<$}\,0001). Total malaria case count had shown two months lagged carry on effect. Moreover, 3~months lagged humidity had significant positive effect on total malaria cases. Malaria prevention interventions and meteorological factors showed statistically significant association with total malaria cases.                                                        Conclusion               Malaria was and will remain to be a major public health problem in the area. The social and economic impact of the disease on the local community is clearly pronounced as it is the leading cause of health facility visit and admission including the mortality associated with it. Scale up of effective interventions is quite important. Continuous monitoring of the performance of the vector control tools needs to be done.},

This method entails the release of large numbers of irradiated males to compete against wild conspecifics for mating with virgin females in the field. The swarming and mating behaviors of this species were conducted at two field sites during the period 2009--2012 in Dongola, northern Sudan. Observations were made in the field sites and in a contained semi-field enclosure. In addition, participation of released irradiated-marked males in the swarms of wild mosquito was investigated. Swarms were observed on sunset in the vicinity of larval habitats around irrigation channel and stopped with the onset of the darkness about 21--25 min after the start. Swarms were observed above visual markers such as palm trees, bare ground, and manure. Several couples were observed leaving the swarms in copula in the direction of the sunlight. The majority of copulations were observed within 12--15 min of the start of swarming. Relatively low insemination rates (28\%) of females collected from coupling pairs were observed. Irradiated-marked males were observed to join the natural swarms regularly, indicating their probable competitiveness with the other wild males. These findings enhance the feasibility of staging an SIT campaign against malaria vector in Northern State-Sudan.},

During mating, male mosquitoes transfer not just sperm, but also seminal fluid proteins that may have profound effects on mated female biology and behavior. In this study, we investigated the role of male body size and mating history on semen depletion, female longevity, and reproductive success in Aedes aegypti L. Small and large males were mated in rapid succession with up to five females. Our results indicate that large males had greater mating capacity than small males. A reduction in fecundity by {$>$}50\% was observed in females that were fourth to mate with small males in comparison with females that mated earlier in sequence. For females mated to large males, this reduction became evident for females that mated fifth in sequence. No loss of fertility (measured as hatch rate) was observed in females that were third-fifth in mating sequence compared with females mated to virgin males. When females were maintained on a low-quality (5\% sucrose) diet, those mated to virgin males had a greater longevity compared with females mated third in sequence. We conclude that small males experience more rapid seminal depletion than large males, and discuss the role of semen depletion in the mated female. Our results contribute toward a better understanding of the complexity of Ae. aegypti mating biology and provide refined estimates of mating capacity for genetic control efforts.},

Very few vector control interventions have a strong evidence base for their public health impact, and those that do are insecticide-based and threatened by resistance. The pipeline of new interventions and new insecticides is being filled and several are undergoing randomised controlled trials. If these are subsequently to be used sustainably, interventions will need to be combined. The major challenge will be to generate the evidence base and funding to achieve this sustainable combination at the country level. Unless this is done, the selection pressure for resistance to the new generation of vector control tools is likely to rapidly reduce our ability to control insect vectors in the foreseeable future.},

This study characterized the breeding habitats of                 Anopheles                 mosquitoes in rural communities in different ecological zones in Ghana during the dry and rainy seasons.

These were Anyakpor (coastal savannah area), Duase (forest area), and Libga, Pagaza, and Kpalsogu (Sahel savannah area). Larvae were collected using standard dippers and were raised in the insectary for identification.                                                        Results                                Out of a total of 7984 mosquito larvae collected, 2152 (27.26\%) were anophelines and were more abundant in the rainy season (70.82\%) than in the dry season (29.18\%). The anophelines comprised 2128 (98.88\%)                 An. gambiae                 s.l., 16 (0.74\%)                 An. rufipes                 , and 8 (0.37\%)                 An. pharoensis                 . In the coastal savannah and forest zones, dug-out wells were the most productive habitat during the dry (1.59 larvae/dip and 1.47 larvae/dip) and rainy seasons (11.28 larvae/dip and 2.05 larvae/dip). Swamps and furrows were the most productive habitats in the Sahel savannah zone during the dry (0.25 larvae/dip) and rainy (2.14 larvae/dip) seasons, respectively.                 Anopheles coluzzii                 was the most abundant sibling species in all the ecological zones.                 Anopheles melas                 and                 An. arabiensis                 were encountered only in the coastal savannah and the Sahel savannah areas, respectively.

  abstract = {Whereas most economic and ecological impacts of tramp ant species stem in large part from numerical dominance and exacerbated aggressiveness of workers, those imposed by alate (winged) ants have been rarely described. In the present study, we report an unprecedented massive alate swarming (i.e., mating flight) event in southern Taiwan by a tramp ant species, Technomyrmex albipes (Smith) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), that triggers immediate pest management responses, and examine factor(s) that potentially contribute to the remarkably high number of alates. We monitored the seasonal activities of T. albipes workers and phenology of alate swarming, attempting to link the worker foraging dynamics with swarm ontogeny. As it was argued that recent streetlight fixtures converted from high-pressure sodium to lightemitting diode (LED) may serve as a major cause of the massive swarming, alates' light color preference was investigated. Sex ratio of trapped alates was also assessed to test whether sex-specific light preference exists in T. albipes. We showed that foraging intensity of workers increased in the spring, peaked in May, and was followed by the nuptial flight season that began in August and lasted for 4 months. The phenological pattern is consistent with the colony dynamics in many other ant species. Although the two light preference experiments did not yield the same results, T. albipes alates overall preferred lights with shorter wavelengths in the active trapping, partially supporting the argument of white LED streetlights contributing to the massive flight. The sex ratio of trapped alates was overall female-biased, suggesting female alates are disproportionally produced and/or more sensitive toward lights.},

Anopheles gambiae s. l                 . is generally thought to utilize puddles over bare soil as its prime larval habitat and to avoid standing water populated with vegetation. In Kisian, Kenya near Kisumu, water often pools in grassy drainage areas both during and after periods of infrequent rains, when typical puddle habitats become scarce because of drying. This raised the question of whether                 An. gambiae                 has the behavioural flexibility to switch ovipositional sites when puddles over bare soil are unavailable.                                                        Methods                                To test whether presence and height of grasses influenced oviposition, wild-caught gravid                 An. gambiae s. l                 . were offered paired choices between wet, bare soil and wet soil populated with mixed grasses or grasses of differing height. No-choice tests were also conducted by giving females either grassy soil or bare soil.                                                        Results               In choice tests, females laid four times more eggs on bare, wet soil than soil populated with grasses. However in no-choice tests, egg output was not significantly different whether grasses were present or not. Females laid significantly more eggs on soil populated with short grass than with medium, or tall grass.                                         Conclusion                                This work shows                 An. gambiae s. l                 . has the capacity to oviposit into grassy aquatic habitats when typical puddles over bare soil are unavailable. This knowledge will need to be considered in the design and implementation of programmes aimed at reducing malaria transmission by suppression of                 An. gambiae s. l                 . immatures.},

Behavioral resistance has been documented to occur in a multitude of insect taxa dating back to the 1940s, but has not received significant research attention due primarily to the complexities of studying insect behavior and a lack of any clear definition of behavioral resistance. In recent years, a systematic effort to investigate the mechanism(s) of behavioral resistance in pest taxa (e.g. the German cockroach and the house fly) has~been undertaken. Here, we practically define behavioral resistance, describe the efforts taken by research groups to elucidate resistance mechanisms, and provide insight on designing appropriate bioassays for investigating behavioral resistance mechanisms in the future.},

This study measures untethered insects performing a solo in-flight visual tracking task and applies system identification techniques to build an experimentally-consistent model of the visual tracking behaviors, and then integrates the measured experimental delay and its variation into a visually interconnected swarm model to develop theoretical and simulated solutions and stability limits. The experimental techniques include the development of a moving visual stimulus and real-time multi camera based tracking system called VISIONS (Visual Input System Identification from Outputs of Naturalistic Swarms) providing the capability to recognize and simultaneously track both a visual stimulus (input) and an insect at a frame rate of 60-120 Hz. A frequency domain analysis of honeybee tracking trajectories is conducted via fast Fourier and Chirp Z transforms, identifying a coherent linear region and its model structure. The model output is compared in time and frequency domain simulations. The experimentally measured delays are then related to probability density functions, and both the measured delays and their distribution are incorporated as inter-agent interaction delays in a second order swarming dynamics model. Linear stability and bifurcation analysis on the long range asymptotic behavior is used to identify delay distributions leading to a family of solutions with stable and unstable swarm center of mass (barycenter) locations. Numerical simulations are used to verify these results with both continuous and measured distributions. The results of this experiment quantify a model structure and temporal lag (transport delay) in the closed loop dynamics, and show that this delay varies across 50 individuals from 5-110ms, with an average delay of 22ms and a standard deviation of 40ms. When analyzed within the swarm model, the measured delays support a diversity of solutions and indicate an unstable barycenter.},

Blood-seeking diel activity cycles of mosquitoes are described from 24 h landing catches on human bait in a field and a forest habitat during June-August in central Sweden.                          2. Daytime activity in the field was low or absent, whilst in the forest activity was relatively even throughout the diel.             3. In both habitats, activity peaks generally occurred about sunset and sunrise and were more distinct in the field than in the forest.                            4. Data from this and other studies show that, in general,               Aedes cinereus               Meigen feeds at night in field-type habitats and               Ae.communis               (DeGeer) during the diurnal-crepuscular period in forest and woodland habitats.                                         5. Although abundant in the study area,               Anopheles maculipennis               Meigen               sensu lato, Culex pipiens               L.,               Cx torrentium               Martini and               Culiseta morsitans               (Theobald) were not caught on the human bait.

  abstract = {Insect swarms are a model system for understanding collective behavior where the collective motion appears in disorder. To initiate and maintain a swarm in place, flying insects often use a visual external cue called a marker. In mosquitoes, understanding the swarming behavior and its relation to the marker has an additional medical relevance since swarming often precedes mating in the wild, thus constituting an important stage to intercept for controlling mosquito population. In this paper, we conduct preliminary experiments to characterize the visual coupling between a swarm of mosquitoes and a marker. A laboratory microcosm with artificial lighting was built to stimulate consistent swarming in the malarial mosquito Anopheles stephensi. The experimental setup was used to film a mosquito swarm with a stereo camera system as a marker was moved back-and-forth with different frequencies. System identification analysis of the frequency response shows that the relationship between the swarm and the marker can be described by delayed second order dynamics in a feedback loop. Further, the length of the internal time delay appears to correlate with the number of mosquitoes swarming on the marker indicating that such a delay may be able capture social interactions within swarming systems. For insect swarms, model fitting of trajectory data provides a way to numerically compare swarming behaviors of different species with respect to marker characteristics. These preliminary results motivate investigating linear dynamic system in feedback as a framework for modeling insect swarms and set the stage for future studies.},

  abstract = {Malaria remains an ongoing public health challenge, with over 600,000 deaths in 2021, of which approximately 96\% occurred in Africa. Despite concerted efforts, the goal of global malaria elimination has stalled in recent years. This has resulted in widespread calls for new control methods. Genetic biocontrol approaches, including those focused on gene-drive-modified mosquitoes (GDMMs), aim to prevent malaria transmission by either reducing the population size of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes or making the mosquitoes less competent to transmit the malaria parasite. The development of both strategies has advanced considerably in recent years, with successful field trials of several biocontrol methods employing live mosquito products and demonstration of the efficacy of GDMMs in insectary-based studies. Live mosquito biocontrol products aim to achieve area-wide control with characteristics that differ substantially from current insecticide-based vector control methods, resulting in some different considerations for approval and implementation. The successful field application of current biocontrol technologies against other pests provides evidence for the promise of these approaches and insights into the development pathway for new malaria control agents. The status of technical development as well as current thinking on the implementation requirements for genetic biocontrol approaches are reviewed, and remaining challenges for public health application in malaria prevention are discussed.},

A quarter of a million in situ insect observations were classified, and several insect taxa were identified based on their modulation signatures. We observed distinct range distributions of male and female mosquitoes in relation to the village periphery, and spatio-temporal behavioral features, such as swarming. Furthermore, we observed that the spatial distributions of males and females change independently of each other during the day, and were able to estimate the daily dispersal of mosquitoes towards and away from the village. The findings of this study demonstrate how lidar-based monitoring could dramatically improve our understanding of malaria vector ecology and control options.},

Using high-accuracy three-dimensional tracking of position in two- and three-dimensional environments, we sought to determine (i) how rats navigated through the environments with respect to gravity, (ii) where rats chose to form their home bases in volumetric space, and (iii) how they navigated to and from these home bases. To evaluate how horizontal biases may affect these behaviours, we compared a 3D maze where animals preferred to move horizontally to a different 3D configuration where all axes were equally energetically costly to traverse. Additionally, we compared home base formation in two-dimensional arenas with and without walls to the three-dimensional climbing mazes. We report that many behaviours exhibited by rats in horizontal spaces naturally extend to fully volumetric ones, such as home base formation and foraging excursions. We also provide further evidence for the strong differentiation of the horizontal and vertical axes: rats showed a horizontal movement bias, they formed home bases mainly in the bottom layers of both mazes and they generally solved the vertical component of return trajectories before and faster than the horizontal component. We explain the bias towards horizontal movements in terms of energy conservation, while the locations of home bases are explained from an information gathering view as a method for correcting self-localisation.},

This study describes the biting hour and host-seeking behavior of Ae. aegypti and Ae. vittatus in three towns. Recently, chikungunya and dengue infections were reported in the study sites. Methods: Biting hour and host-seeking behaviors of Ae. aegypti and Ae. vittatus were studied from June to September 2023, in Genda-Wuha, Kokit, and Metema-Yohannes towns, Metema district, Northwest Ethiopia. CDC-LT traps were set running indoors and outdoors for 24 h closer to humans sleeping inside unimpregnated mosquito nets. At the same time, CDC-LT traps were set running overnight closer to domestic animals' shelters located within a 50-m radius of the main residence. Mosquitoes trapped in CDC-LT were collected every hour. The study was conducted four times in each town during the wet season. A chi-square test was employed to examine biting hour and host-seeking behavior. Results: Aedes aegypti was observed to be highly exophilic and active during the daylight hours. Aedes aegypti exhibited a peak biting rate between 07:00 and 08:00 with the biting rate of 4.5/person/hour followed by from 17:00 pm to 18:00 pm with the biting rate of 3.75/person/hour. The hourly biting rate of Ae. aegypti differed significantly. Its peak indoor biting rate was from 19:00 to 20:00 with the rate of 2.00 bites/person/hour followed by from 08:00 to 09:00 with the rate of 1.50 bites/person/hour and the biting rates differed significantly across the hours (F = 240.046; p = 0.001). Aedes vittatus also exhibited a biting rate similar to that of Ae. aegypti. Both Ae. aegypti and Ae. vittatus were abundantly collected from nearby human sleeping arrangements than from the shelters of cattle, sheep, goats, and donkeys. The highest proportions of Ae. aegypti (91.21\%) and Ae. vittatus (89.87\%) were unfed. Conclusions: Aedes aegypti and Ae. vittatus exhibited peak biting rates during morning and early night hours that aligned with the active daily routine practices of the local community. This could potentially expose the inhabitants to viral diseases transmitted by Ae. aegypti and Ae. vittatus.},

  abstract = {The term `sex roles' encapsulates male--female differences in mate searching, competitive traits that increase mating/fertilization opportunities, choosiness about mates and parental care. Theoretical models suggest that biased sex ratios drive the evolution of sex roles. To model sex role evolution, it is essential to note that in most sexually reproducing species (haplodiploid insects are an exception), each offspring has one father and one mother. Consequently, the total number of offspring produced by each sex is identical, so the mean number of offspring produced by individuals of each sex depends on the sex ratio (Fisher condition). Similarly, the total number of heterosexual matings is identical for each sex. On average, neither sex can mate nor breed more often when the sex ratio is even. But equally common in               which               sex ratio? The Fisher condition only applies to some reproductive measures (e.g. lifetime offspring production or matings) for certain sex ratios (e.g. operational or adult sex ratio; OSR, ASR). Here, we review recent models that clarify whether a biased OSR, ASR or sex ratio at maturation (MSR) have a causal or correlational relationship with the evolution of sex differences in parental care and competitive traits---two key components of sex roles. We suggest that it is more fruitful to understand the combined effect of the MSR and mortality rates while caring and competing than that of the ASR itself. In short, we argue that the ASR does not have a causal role in the evolution of parental care. We point out, however, that the ASR can be a cue for adaptive phenotypic plasticity in how each sex invests in parental care.

We first divided the existing papers into geospatial, visual, or audio categories. For each category, we analyzed the machine learning pipeline, from dataset creation to model performance. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities for further research. While the reviewed ML methods in mosquito control are promising, we recommend a) increased use of crowdsourced and citizen science data, b) a standardized and open ML pipeline for reproducible results, and c) research that incorporates advances in ML. With these suggestions, ML techniques could lead to effective mosquito control in urban environments.},

Unfortunately, the species ecology is minimally understood, partly because of difficulties in laboratory colonization. This study describes the first observations of An. funestus swarms in Tanzania, possibly heralding new opportunities for control. Method: Using systematic searches by community-based volunteers and expert entomologists, An. funestus swarms were identified in two villages in Ulanga and Kilombero districts in south-eastern Tanzania, starting June 2018. Swarms were characterized by size, height, start- and end-times, presence of copulation and associated environmental features. Samples of male mosquitoes from the swarms were examined for sexual maturity by observing genitalia rotation, species identity using polymerase chain reaction and wing sizes. Results: 581 An. funestus (98.1\% males (n = 570) and 1.9\% (n = 11) females) and 9 Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) males were sampled using sweep nets from the 81 confirmed swarms in two villages (Ikwambi in Kilombero district and Tulizamoyo in Ulanga district). Six copulation events were observed in the swarms. Mean density (95\% CL) of An. funestus caught/swarm/village/evening was 6.6 (5.9--7.2) in Tulizamoyo and 10.8 (5.8--15.8) in Ikwambi. 87.7\% (n = 71) of the swarms were found in Tulizamoyo, while 12.3\% (n = 10) were in Ikwambi. Mean height of swarms was 1.7 m (0.9--2.5 m), while mean duration was 12.9 (7.9--17.9) minutes. The PCR analysis confirmed that 100\% of all An. funestus s.l. samples processed were An. funestus sensu stricto. Mean wing length of An. funestus males was 2.47 mm (2.0--2.8 mm), but there was no difference between swarming males and indoor-resting males. Most swarms (95.0\%) occurred above bare ground, sometime on front lawns near human dwellings, and repeatedly in the same locations. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated occurrence of An. funestus swarms for the first time in Tanzania. Further investigations could identify new opportunities for improved control of this dominant malaria vector, possibly by targeting the swarms.},

A thorough understanding of vector bionomics is important as it enables the implementation of targeted and effective vector control interventions. Malaria vector surveillance efforts in the country have tended to focus on historically known primary vectors. The current study sought to determine the taxonomic status of samples collected from five different malaria epidemiological zones in Kenya as well as describe the population genetic structure and insecticide resistance profiles in relation to other                 An. coluzzii                 populations.                                                        Methods                                Mosquitoes were sampled as larvae from Busia, Kwale, Turkana, Kirinyaga and Kiambu counties, representing the range of malaria endemicities in Kenya, in 2019 and 2021 and emergent adults analysed using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data processed in accordance with the                 Anopheles gambiae                 1000 Genomes Project phase 3. Where available, historical samples from the same sites were included for WGS. Comparisons were made with                 An. coluzzii                 cohorts from West and Central Africa.                                                        Results                                This study reports the detection of                 An. coluzzii                 for the first time in Kenya. The species was detected in Turkana County across all three time points from which samples were analyzed and its presence confirmed through taxonomic analysis. Additionally, there was a lack of strong population genetic differentiation between                 An. coluzzii                 from Kenya and those from the more northerly regions of West and Central Africa, suggesting they represent a connected extension to the known species range. Mutations associated with target-site resistance to DDT and pyrethroids and metabolic resistance to DDT were found at high frequencies up to 64\%. The profile and frequencies of the variants observed were similar to                 An. coluzzii                 from West and Central Africa but the                 ace-1                 mutation linked to organophosphate and carbamate resistance present in                 An. coluzzii                 from coastal West Africa was absent in Kenya.                                                        Conclusions               These findings emphasize the need for the incorporation of genomics in comprehensive and routine vector surveillance to inform on the range of malaria vector species, and their insecticide resistance status to inform the choice of effective vector control approaches.},

Previously, we determined lethal exposure levels for a variety of lasers and pulse conditions on anesthetized               Anopheles stephensi               mosquitoes. In this work, similar studies were performed while the subjects were freely flying within transparent cages two meters from the optical system; a proof-of-principle demonstration of a 30~m system was also performed. From the dose--response curves of mortality data created as a function of various beam diameter, pulse width, and power conditions at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, the visible wavelengths required significantly lower laser exposure than near infrared wavelengths to disable subjects, though near infrared sources remain attractive given their cost and retina safety. The flight behavior of the subjects and the performance of the tracking system were found to have no impact on the mortality outcomes for pulse durations up to 25~ms, which appears to be the ideal duration to minimize required laser power. The results of this study affirm the practicality of using optical approaches to protect people and crops from pestilent flying insects.},

Here, we applied Wright's               F               -statistic, analysis of molecular variance, Bayesian structure analysis, and discriminant analysis of principle components to microsatellite genotype data to analyze the population genetic structure of               Anopheles farauti               between and within the northern and southern lowland plains and of               Anopheles punctulatus               within the northern plain of Papua New Guinea after such a program.

A large, panmictic population of               An. punctulatus               pre-LLIN program diverged into two subregional populations corresponding to Madang and East Sepik provinces post-LLIN distribution and experienced a genetic bottleneck during this process. By contrast, the               An. farauti               population existed as two regional populations isolated by mountain ranges pre-LLIN, a genetic structure that persisted after the distribution of LLINs with no further geographic differentiation nor evidence of a genetic bottleneck.

This study investigated the complex members and the insecticide resistance in the               Anopheles gambiae               s.l. populations in coastal C{\^o}te d'Ivoire. Between 2018 and 2020, cross sectional survey bioassays were conducted on female               An               .               gambiae               s.l. mosquitoes in three coastal health districts (Aboisso, Jacqueville and San Pedro) of C{\^o}te d'Ivoire. Pyrethroids deltamethrin, permethrin and alphacypermethrin (1X, 5X and 10X), clothianidin and synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) combined with pyrethroid 1X were tested using WHO tube bioassays.

These populations displayed strong resistance to pyrethroids at standard diagnostic doses, with mortality remaining below 98\% even at 10X doses, except for alphacypermethrin in Aboisso.

  abstract = {Background: Aedes aegypti is a potential vector for several arboviruses including dengue and Zika viruses. The species seems to be restricted to subtropical/tropical habitats and has difficulties in establishing permanent populations in southern Europe, probably due to constraints during the winter season. The aim of this study was to systematically analyze the cold tolerance (CT) of Ae. aegypti in its most cold-resistant life stage, the eggs. Methods: The CT of Ae. aegypti eggs was compared with that of Ae. albopictus which is well established in large parts of Europe. By systematically studying the literature (meta-analysis), we recognized that CT has been rarely tested in Ae. aegypti eggs, but eggs can survive at zero and sub-zero temperatures for certain exposure periods. To overcome potential bias from experimental differences between studies, we then conducted species comparisons using a harmonized high-resolution CT measuring method. From subtropical populations of the same origin, the survival (hatching in \%) and emergence of adults of both species were measured after zero and sub-zero temperature exposures for up to 9 days (3 {$^\circ$}C, 0 {$^\circ$}C and - 2 {$^\circ$}C: {$\leq$} 9 days; - 6 {$^\circ$}C: {$\leq$} 2 days). Results: Our data show that Ae. aegypti eggs can survive low and sub-zero temperatures for a short time period similar to or even better than those of Ae. albopictus. Moreover, after short sub-zero exposures of eggs of both species, individuals still developed into viable adults (Ae. aegypti: 3 adults emerged after 6 days at - 2 {$^\circ$}C, Ae. albopictus: 1 adult emerged after 1 day at - 6 {$^\circ$}C). Conclusions: Thus, both the literature and the present experimental data indicate that a cold winter may not be the preventing factor for the re-establishment of the dengue vector Ae. aegypti in southern Europe.},

The eggs of Ae. albopictus are the most cold resistant life stage and thus, the cold hardiness of eggs is used to predict the future occurrence of the species in distribution models. However, the mechanism of cold hardiness has yet to be revealed. To address this question, we analyzed the layers of diapausing and cold acclimatized eggs of a temperate population of Ae. albopictus in a full factorial test design using transmission electron microscopy. We reviewed the hypotheses that a thickened wax layer or chorion is the cause of cold hardiness but found no evidence. As a result of the induced diapause, the thickness of the dark endochorion as a layer of high electron density and thus an assumed location for waxes was decreasing. We therefore hypothesized a qualitative alteration of the wax layer due to compaction. Cold acclimation was causing an increase in the thickness of the middle serosa cuticle indicating a detachment of serosa membrane from the endochorion as a potential adaptation strategy to isolate inoculating ice formations in the inter-membranous space.

Divergence occurs at three discrete islands in genomes that are otherwise nearly identical. An ``islands of speciation'' model proposes that diverged regions contain genes that are maintained by selection in the face of gene flow. An alternative ``incidental island'' model maintains that gene flow between M and S is effectively zero and that divergence islands are unrelated to speciation. A ``divergence island SNP'' assay was used to explore the spatial and temporal distributions of hybrid genotypes. Results revealed that hybrid individuals occur at frequencies ranging between 5\% and 97\% in every population examined. A temporal analysis revealed that assortative mating is unstable and periodically breaks down, resulting in extensive hybridization. Results suggest that hybrids suffer a fitness disadvantage, but at least some hybrid genotypes are viable. Stable introgression of the 2L speciation island occurred at one site following a hybridization event.},

First, patterns of host selection were assessed by the identification of the blood meal origin of indoor-resting samples. Inherent host preferences were then determined by two odor-baited entry traps, set side by side in a choice arrangement, releasing either human or calf odor. The proportion of feeds taken on humans was around 40\%, whereas 88\% of trapped               An. gambiae               ``chose'' the human-baited trap, indicating a zoophilic pattern of host selection despite a stronger trap entry response with human odor.

Vertical transmission (VT) is considered a possible mechanism for the persistence of arboviruses during periods unfavorable for horizontal transmission, but the extent and epidemiological significance of this phenomenon have remained controversial. To help resolve this question, we reviewed over a century of published literature on VT to analyze historical trends of scientific investigations on experimental and natural occurrence of VT in mosquitoes. Our synthesis highlights the influence of major events of public health significance in arbovirology on the number of VT publications. Epidemiological landmarks such as emergence events have significantly stimulated VT research. Our analysis also reveals the association between the evolution of virological assays and the probability of VT detection. Increased sensitivity and higher-throughput of modern laboratory assays resulted in enhanced VT detection. In general, VT contribution to arbovirus persistence is likely modest because vertically infected mosquitoes are rarely observed in nature. Taken together, however, our results call for caution when interpreting VT studies because their conclusions are context- and method-dependent.},

These effects can be either beneficial, such as boosting the immune response, or harmful, such as decreasing survival, for example. Cricket females are among the most used models for understanding these life history trade-offs. We recently demonstrated that mated females have a slight cost of reproduction in survival that could be explained if they differed in resource consumption compared to unmated, being able to avoid putative damages of reproduction on self-maintenance. To test whether mating status modulates feeding behavior and self-maintenance (i.e., immunity), we performed two experimental blocks: In the first, we measure the food intake of both virgin and mated females of Gryllus (Gryllus) assimilis (Fabricius, 1775). In the second, we compared the ability to mount an acute immune response (encapsulation) against a nylon filament implant, a widely used method to challenge the insect immune system. Results showed that mated females did not increase food consumption compared to pre-mating period, however, the virgin group (control) drastically decreased the amount of food ingested. Furthermore, no difference in immune response was found between mating status. As mated females ingested more food than those virgins of the same age, we suggest the feeding behavior (i.e., resource acquisition) as one of the used behavioral strategies to maintain immune ability, high oviposition rates, and survival of mated females of G. (G.) assimilis when fed ad libitum.},

A morphological model is built based on an effective differential geometric method for reconstructing geometry of and a specific grid generator for the wings and body; and a kinematic model is constructed capable to mimic the realistic wing--body kinematics of flapping flight. A fortified FVM-based NS solver for dynamically moving multi-blocked, overset-grid systems is developed and verified to be self-consistent by a variety of benchmark tests; and evaluation of flapping energetics is established on inertial and aerodynamic forces, torques and powers. Validation of this integrated insect dynamic flight simulator is achieved by comparisons of aerodynamic force-production with measurements in terms of the time-varying and mean lift and drag forces. Results for three typical insect hovering flights (hawkmoth, honeybee and fruitfly) over a wide rang of Reynolds numbers from O(102) to O(104) demonstrate its feasibility in accurately modeling and quantitatively evaluating the unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms in insect flapping flight. {\'O} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We then modelled the relative frequency of               An. coluzzii               larvae to these physicochemical parameters in order to investigate environmental patterns.

How do communal animals manage such conflicts without escalating antagonistic relationships? In the Sahara Desert, we studied the mating system of gregarious-behaving desert locusts, the world's most destructive locust. Despite being widespread and abundant during plagues, its populations are otherwise difficult to access, and its reproductive behaviors in the field are understudied. We show that female locusts behaviorally overcome the costs of male mating harassment: females occupy separate sites before and after mating. Only females with ripe ovaries arrive at male-biased lekking groups. Hence, substantial social conflicts can be simply managed by behaviors. These findings invite to explore the evolutionary hypotheses behind lekking with a density-dependent plastic species.           ,              Male mating harassment may occur when females and males do not have the same mating objectives. Communal animals need to manage the costs of male mating harassment. Here, we demonstrate how desert locusts in dense populations reduce such conflicts through behaviors. In transient populations (of solitarious morphology but gregarious behavior), we found that nongravid females occupied separate sites far from males and were not mating, whereas males aggregated on open ground (leks), waiting for gravid females to enter the lekking sites. Once a male mounted a gravid female, no other males attacked the pair; mating pairs were thereby protected during the vulnerable time of oviposition. In comparison, solitarious locusts displayed a balanced sex ratio in low-density populations, and females mated irrespective of their ovarian state. Our results indicate that the mating behaviors of desert locusts are density dependent and that sex-biased behavioral group separation may minimize the costs of male mating harassment and competition.},

These studies further our fundamental understanding of the reproductive biology of mosquitoes. In addition, our analyses using stereoscopic video of swarms of the African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae have produced results that should be relevant to any ``release-based'' method of control including Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) and genetically modified male mosquitoes (GMM). The relevance of the results is primarily due to the fact that any mosquito vectors released for control are almost certainly going to be males; further, for SIT, GMM or similar approaches to be successful, the released males will have to successfully locate swarms and then mate with wild females. Thus, understanding and potentially manipulating the mating process could play a key role in future control programs. Our experience points to special challenges created by stereoscopic video of swarms. These include the expected technical difficulties of capturing usable images of mosquitoes in the field, and creating an automated tracking system to enable generation of large numbers of three dimensional tracks over many seconds of footage. Once the data are collected, visualization and application of appropriate statistical and analytic methods also are required. We discuss our recent progress on these problems, give an example of a statistical approach to quantify individual male movement in a swarm with some novel results, and suggest further studies incorporating experimental manipulation and three dimensional localization and tracking of individual mosquitoes in wild swarms.},

  abstract = {Evolution has produced vast morphological and behavioral diversity amongst insects, including very successful adaptations to a diverse range of ecological niches spanning the invasion of the sky by flying insects, the crawling lifestyle on (or below) the earth, and the (semi-)aquatic life on (or below) the water surface. Developing the ability to extract a maximal amount of useful information from their environment was crucial for ensuring the survival of many insect species. Navigating insects rely heavily on a combination of different visual and non-visual cues to reliably orient under a wide spectrum of environmental conditions while avoiding predators. The pattern of linearly polarized skylight that results from scattering of sunlight in the atmosphere is one important navigational cue that many insects can detect. Here we summarize progress made toward understanding how different insect species sense polarized light. First, we present behavioral studies with ``true'' insect navigators (central-place foragers, like honeybees or desert ants), as well as insects that rely on polarized light to improve more ``basic'' orientation skills (like dung beetles). Second, we provide an overview over the anatomical basis of the polarized light detection system that these insects use, as well as the underlying neural circuitry. Third, we emphasize the importance of physiological studies (electrophysiology, as well as genetically encoded activity indicators, in               Drosophila               ) for understanding both the structure and function of polarized light circuitry in the insect brain. We also discuss the importance of an alternative source of polarized light that can be detected by many insects: linearly polarized light reflected off shiny surfaces like water represents an important environmental factor, yet the anatomy and physiology of underlying circuits remain incompletely understood.},

  abstract = {Briefly stated, the insect olfactometer consists of a specially constructed Y-tube through which insects pass from a dark chamber, being attracted by a light suspended near the free ends of the forks of this tube. The dark chamber is attached to the base of the Y-tube, while a suction apparatus to draw odors through the forks is attached at the point where the base and forks unite. The principle involved is to attract the insects equally toward the entrances of the forks by the light stimulus, but when ready to enter these forks they are influenced unequally by the odors drawn through the forks, one fork serving as an attractive or repellent side and the other fork as the control side. The whole apparatus is so constructed and manipulated that the interfering factors are practically controlled, leaving only the olfactory responses to be recorded.},

  abstract = {Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) cover the cuticles of virtually all insects, serving as a waterproofing agent and as a communication signal. The causes for the high CHC variation between species, and the factors influencing CHC profiles, are scarcely understood. Here, we compare CHC profiles of ant species from seven biogeographic regions, searching for physiological constraints and for climatic and biotic selection pressures. Molecule length constrained CHC composition: long-chain profiles contained fewer linear alkanes, but more hydrocarbons with disruptive features in the molecule. This is probably owing to selection on the physiology to build a semi-fluid cuticular layer, which is necessary for waterproofing and communication. CHC composition also depended on the precipitation in the ants' habitats. Species from wet climates had more alkenes and fewer dimethyl alkanes than those from drier habitats, which can be explained by different waterproofing capacities of these compounds. By contrast, temperature did not affect CHC composition. Mutualistically associated (parabiotic) species possessed profiles highly distinct from non-associated species. Our study is, to our knowledge, the first to show systematic impacts of physiological, climatic and biotic factors on quantitative CHC composition across a global, multi-species dataset. We demonstrate how they jointly shape CHC profiles, and advance our understanding of the evolution of this complex functional trait in insects.},

In contrast, the southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus Say, lacks this capacity and is therefore unable to survive the harsh winters found in northern regions of North America. These two species are capable of forming fertile hybrids in the United States, yet the diapause characteristics of these hybrids have not been extensively investigated. We crossed Cx. pipiens from Columbus, OH, with Cx. quinquefasciatus from Vero Beach, FL, and reared F1 hybrids from all mothers separately under diapause-inducing, short-day conditions (a photoperiod of 8:16 [L:D] h) at 18 C. Egg follicle length and lipid content were used to assess the diapause status of hybrids. Diapause incidence of hybrids varied widely for progeny from different mothers of the same species, but hybrids with Cx. pipiens mothers were consistently more prone to enter diapause than hybrids that had Cx. quinquefasciatus mothers. Our results suggest a strong maternal influence on the diapause phenotype and that a high percentage (45--75\%) of Cx. pipiens--Cx. quinquefasciatus hybrids are capable of entering diapause. This implies that many hybrids can successfully overwinter, leading to a possible widening of the hybrid zone of these two species in North America.},

  abstract = {In social insects, individuals of working caste coordinate their actions to manage various collective tasks. Such collective behaviours exist not only in workers but also in winged reproductives (alates). During certain seasons, newly emerged alates fly from the nest to disperse and find mating partners in a synchronized manner. This `swarming' behaviour is one of the collective behaviours that involve the greatest number of individuals in social insects. However, such synchronization is considered to be caused by the response to specific environmental cues rather than behavioural coordination among colony members. Here, we show that a termite               Reticulitermes kanmonensis               shows synchronized dispersal flight among alates within the same colony even under the constant temperature environment. Under the semi-field environment with fluctuating temperatures, alates within the same colony synchronized their dispersal flight under higher temperatures, while flight was suppressed under lower temperatures. We observed that termites synchronized their dispersal flights even under constant temperature conditions in the laboratory (20{\textcelsius}), indicating that environmental cues are not always necessary for synchronization. In either case, higher synchronization happened with a larger number of alates. These results suggest that social factors interplay with environmental cues to enable the synchronized swarming flight of social insects.},

  abstract = {To escape after taking a blood meal, a mosquito must exert forces sufficiently high to take off when carrying a load roughly equal to its body weight, while simultaneously avoiding detection by minimizing tactile signals exerted on the host's skin. We studied this trade-off between escape speed and stealth in the malaria mosquito Anopheles coluzzii using 3D motion analysis of high-speed stereoscopic videos of mosquito take-offs and aerodynamic modeling. We found that during the push-off phase, mosquitoes enhanced take-off speed using aerodynamic forces generated by the beating wings in addition to leg-based push-off forces, whereby wing forces contributed 61\% of the total push-off force. Exchanging legderived push-off forces for wing-derived aerodynamic forces allows the animal to reduce peak force production on the host's skin. By slowly extending their long legs throughout the push-off, mosquitoes spread push-off forces over a longer time window than insects with short legs, thereby further reducing peak leg forces. Using this specialized take-off behavior, mosquitoes are capable of reaching take-off speeds comparable to those of similarly sized fruit flies, but with weight-normalized peak leg forces that were only 27\% of those of the fruit flies. By limiting peak leg forces, mosquitoes possibly reduce the chance of being detected by the host. The resulting combination of high take-off speed and low tactile signals on the host might help increase the mosquito's success in escaping from blood-hosts, which consequently also increases the chance of transmitting vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, to future hosts.},

  abstract = {Background: The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is an extremely invasive, globally distributed and medically important vector of various human and veterinary pathogens. In Germany, where this species was recently introduced, its establishment may become modulated by interspecific competition from autochthonous mosquito species, especially Culex pipiens (s.l.). While competitive superiority of Ae. albopictus to Cx. pipiens (s.l.) has been described elsewhere, it has not been assessed in the epidemiological conditions of Germany. The present study aimed to determine if such superiority exists under the physicochemical and microclimatic conditions typical for container habitats in Germany. Methods: In a replacement series experiment, the larval and pupal responses of Ae. albopictus and Cx. pipiens (s.l.) (mortality, development time, growth) to interspecific interaction (five larval ratios) at (sub-)optimal temperatures (15, 20 and 25 {$^\circ$}C) and differing food supply (3 and 6 mg animal-based food larva-1) were investigated using a randomized split-plot design. In addition to physicochemical measurements of the test media, natural physicochemical conditions were determined for comparative analyses in mosquito breeding sites across the Rhine-Main metropolitan region of Germany. Results: Under the physicochemical and microclimatic conditions similar to the breeding sites of the Rhine-Main region, competitive superiority of Cx. pipiens (s.l.) to Ae. albopictus in terms of larval survival was more frequently observed than balanced coexistence. Food regime and multifactorial interactions, but not temperature alone, were controlling factors for interspecific competition. Larval food regime and the larval ratio of Ae. albopictus influenced the physicochemistry and algal growth at 15 {$^\circ$}C, with increased Ae. albopictus mortality linked to a decreasing number of Scenedesmus, Oocystis and Anabaena algae. Conclusions: Under the present environmental conditions, the spread of Ae. albopictus from isolated foci in Germany may generally be slowed by biotic interactions with the ubiquitous Cx. pipiens (s.l.) (and potentially other container-breeding mosquito species) and by limnic microalgae in microhabitats with high resource levels. Detailed knowledge of the context dependency in temperate mosquito ecology, and interrelations of physicochemistry and phycology may help to achieve a better understanding of the upcoming Ae. albopictus colonization processes in central and northern Europe.},

  abstract = {Maternally inherited bacterial endosymbionts are common in many arthropod species. Some endosymbionts cause female-biased sex ratio distortion in their hosts that can result in profound changes to a host's mating behaviour and reproductive biology. Dance flies (Diptera: Empidinae) are well known for their unusual reproductive biology, including species with female-specific ornamentation and female-biased lek-like swarming behaviour. The cause of the repeated evolution of female ornaments in these flies remains unknown, but is probably associated with female-biased sex ratios in individual species. In this study we assessed whether dance flies harbour sex ratio distorting endosymbionts that might have driven these mating system evolutionary changes. We measured the incidence and prevalence of infection by three endosymbionts that are known to cause female-biased sex ratios in other insect hosts (Wolbachia, Rickettsia and Spiroplasma) across 20 species of dance flies. We found evidence of widespread infection by all three symbionts and variation in sex-specific prevalence across the taxa sampled. However, there was no relationship between infection prevalence and adult sex ratio measures and no evidence that female ornaments are associated with high prevalences of sex-biased symbiont infections. We conclude that the current distribution of endosymbiont infections is unlikely to explain the diversity in mating systems among dance fly species.},

While there are several models concerning the evolution of male-specific ornaments, it is not clear how, or under what circumstances, those models apply to female-specific ornament evolution. Here, we present a manipulative field experiment that explores the theoretical `trait space' of multiple female-specific ornaments to study how these unusual traits evolved. We measured the attractiveness of two female-specific ornaments (pinnate leg scales and inflatable abdominal sacs) in the dance fly               Rhamphomyia longicauda               in a wild mating swarm. We found significant directional preferences for larger ornaments of both types; however, variation in one of the ornaments (abdominal sacs) was almost three times more effective at improving attractiveness. The abdominal ornament was consistently effective in increasing attractiveness to males regardless of leg ornament expression, while leg ornament size was only effective if abdominal ornaments were very small. These results are consistent with predictions from a sexual conflict model of ornament expression in supporting the probable role of deception in the evolution of female-specific ornaments among dance flies. Sexual conflict can be an important force in generating elaborate sex-specific ornaments in females as well as males.},

This review explores the incorporation of traditional vector control techniques with emerging               Wolbachia               -based interventions.               Wolbachia               , a naturally occurring bacteria, offers a novel approach for combatting vector-borne diseases, including malaria, by reducing the mosquitoes' ability to transmit these diseases. The study explores the rationale for this integration, presenting various case studies and pilot projects that have exhibited significant success. Employing a multi-dimensional approach that includes community mobilization, environmental modifications, and new biological methods, the paper posits that integrated efforts could mark a turning point in the struggle against malaria. Our findings indicate that incorporating               Wolbachia               -based strategies into existing vector management programs not only is feasible but also heightens the efficacy of malaria control initiatives in different countries especially in Pakistan.

Integrated malaria prevention advocates the use of several malaria prevention measures holistically at households and in the community. The aim of this systematic review was to collate and summarize the impact of integrated malaria prevention in low- and middle-income countries on malaria burden.                                         Methods               Literature on integrated malaria prevention, defined as the use of two or more malaria prevention methods holistically, was searched from 1st January 2001 to 31st July 2021. The primary outcome variables were malaria incidence and prevalence, while the secondary outcome measures were human biting and entomological inoculation rates, and mosquito mortality.                                         Results               A total of 10,931 studies were identified by the search strategy. After screening, 57 articles were included in the review. Studies included cluster randomized controlled trials, longitudinal studies, programme evaluations, experimental hut/houses, and field trials. Various interventions were used, mainly combinations of two or three malaria prevention methods including insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), topical repellents, insecticide sprays, microbial larvicides, and house improvements including screening, insecticide-treated wall hangings, and screening of eaves. The most common methods used in integrated malaria prevention were ITNs and IRS, followed by ITNs and topical repellents. There was reduced incidence and prevalence of malaria when multiple malaria prevention methods were used compared to single methods. Mosquito human biting and entomological inoculation rates were significantly reduced, and mosquito mortality increased in use of multiple methods compared to single interventions. However, a few studies showed mixed results or no benefits of using multiple methods to prevent malaria.                                         Conclusion               Use of multiple malaria prevention methods was effective in reducing malaria infection and mosquito density in comparison with single methods. Results from this systematic review can be used to inform future research, practice, policy and programming for malaria control in endemic countries.},

  abstract = {In the selection of oviposition sites female mosquitoes use various cues to assess site quality to optimize survival of progeny. The presence of conspecific larvae influences this process. Interactive effects of oviposition site selection were studied in the malaria mosquito Anopheles coluzzii Coetzee \& Wilkerson in dual- and no-choice assays, by exposing single gravid mosquitoes to oviposition cups containing 1) larvae of different developmental stages, 2) larvae-conditioned water (LCW), and 3) cups where visual cues of conspecific larvae were absent. Early-stage conspecific larvae had a positive effect on the oviposition response. By contrast, late stages of conspecific larvae had a negative effect. Oviposition choice was dependent on larval density. Moreover, in oviposition cups where larvae were hidden from view, late-stage larvae had a significant negative effect on oviposition suggesting the involvement of olfactory cues. LCW had no effect on oviposition response, indicating involvement of chemicals produced by larvae in vivo. It is concluded that the presence of larvae in a breeding site affects the oviposition response depending on the development stage of the larvae. These responses appear to be mediated by olfactory cues emitted by the larval habitat containing live larvae, resulting in the enhanced reproductive fitness of the females.},

  abstract = {Aerodynamic performance and agility during flapping flight are determined by the combination of wing shape and kinematics. The degree of morphological and kinematic optimization is unknown and depends upon a large parameter space. Aimed at providing an accurate and computationally inexpensive modelling tool for flapping-wing aerodynamics, we propose a novel CFD (computational fluid dynamics)-informed quasi-steady model (CIQSM), which assumes that the aerodynamic forces on a flapping wing can be decomposed into quasi-steady forces and parameterized based on CFD results. Using least-squares fitting, we determine a set of proportional coefficients for the quasi-steady model relating wing kinematics to instantaneous aerodynamic force and torque; we calculate power as the product of quasi-steady torques and angular velocity. With the quasi-steady model fully and independently parameterized on the basis of high-fidelity CFD modelling, it is capable of predicting flapping-wing aerodynamic forces and power more accurately than the conventional blade element model (BEM) does. The improvement can be attributed to, for instance, taking into account the effects of the induced downwash and the wing tip vortex on the force generation and power consumption. Our model is validated by comparing the aerodynamics of a CFD model and the present quasi-steady model using the example case of a hovering hawkmoth. This demonstrates that the CIQSM outperforms the conventional BEM while remaining computationally cheap, and hence can be an effective tool for revealing the mechanisms of optimization and control of kinematics and morphology in flapping-wing flight for both bio-flyers and unmanned aerial systems.},

  abstract = {At temperate latitudes, Culex (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes typically overwinter as adult females in reproductive arrest and also may serve as reservoir hosts for arboviruses when cold temperatures arrest viral replication. To evaluate their role in the persistence of West Nile virus (WNV) in the Sacramento Valley of California, the induction and termination of diapause were investigated for members of the Culex pipiens (L.) complex, Culex tarsalis Coquillett, and Culex stigmatosoma Dyar under {\TH}eld, seminatural, and experimental conditions. All Culex spp. remained vagile throughout winter, enabling the collection of 3,174 females and 1,706 males from diverse habitats during the winters of 2010 {\DH}2012. Overwintering strategies included both quiescence and diapause. In addition, Cx. pipiens form molestus Forsk{\textasciidieresis}al females remained reproductively active in both underground and aboveground habitats. Some blood-fed, gravid, and parous Cx. tarsalis and Cx. pipiens complex females were collected throughout the winter period. Under both {\TH}eld and experimental conditions, Cx. tarsalis and Cx. stigmatosoma females exposed to autumnal conditions arrested primary follicular maturation at previtellogenic stage I, with primary to secondary follicular ratios 1.5 (indicative of a hormonally induced diapause). In contrast, most Cx. pipiens complex females did not enter reproductive diapause and ovarian follicles matured to stage I{\DH}II (host-seeking arrest) or were found in various stages of degeneration. Diapause was initiated in the majority of Cx. tarsalis and Cx. stigmatosoma females by mid-late October and was terminated after the winter solstice, but hostseeking seemed limited by temperature. An accrual of 97.52 30.7 and 162.85 79.3 degree-days after the winter solstice was estimated to be necessary for diapause termination in Cx. tarsalis under {\TH}eld and seminatural conditions, respectively. An increase in the proportion of blood-fed Culex females in resting collections occurred concurrently with diapause termination in {\TH}eld populations based on ovarian morphometrics. WNV RNA was detected in one pool of 18 males and in a single blood-fed female Cx. tarsalis collected during winter. Therefore, both vertically and horizontally infected Culex females may persist through winter and possibly transmit WNV after diapause termination in late winter or early spring in the Sacramento Valley of California.},

  abstract = {Background: The recent resurgence of interest in sterile insect techniques to control vector mosquitoes has renewed interest in novel methods for observing mating behavior. Malarial vectors of the Anopheles gambiae complex are known to mate in swarms at specific locations at dawn and dusk. Most knowledge of mosquito swarming behavior is derived from field observations and a few experimental studies designed to assess critical parameters that affect mosquito swarming. However, such studies are difficult to implement in the field because of uncontrollable environmental factors and mosquito conditions. Here, we present two experimental setups specifically designed to analyze mosquito swarming behavior and provide evidence that swarming behavior of mosquitoes can be generated and accurately assessed under both semi-field and laboratory conditions. Methods: The Mosquito Ecology Research Facility setup is a semi-field enclosure made of 12 compartments (10.0 {\texttimes} 6.0 {\texttimes} 4.5 m L {\texttimes}W {\texttimes} H each) exposed to ambient meteorological and lighting conditions. The laboratory setup consists of a windowless room (5.1 {\texttimes} 4.7 {\texttimes} 3.0 m) in which both environmental and mosquito conditions can be controlled. In the two setups, 300 3--6-days-old An. coluzzii virgin males were released and some swarm characteristics were recorded such as the time at which the swarm started, the number of mosquitoes in the swarm and the height. Climatic conditions in the semi-field setup were also recorded. Results: In both setups, An. coluzzii males displayed stereotyped and consistent swarming behavior day after day; males gradually gather into a swarm over a ground marker at sunset, flying in loops in relation to specific visual features on the ground. Although semi-field climatic conditions were slightly different from outdoors conditions, they did not impede swarming behavior and swarm characteristics were similar to those observed in the field. Conclusions: Swarm characteristics and their consistency across days provide evidences that these facilities can be used confidently to study swarming behavior. These facilities come to complement existing semi-field setups and pave the way for new experimental studies which will enhance our understanding of mating behavior but also mosquito ecology and evolution, a prerequisite for application of genetic approaches to malaria control.},

  abstract = {Background: It is assumed that malaria vectors feed on locally available nectar sources to obtain energy. Sugar feeding is energetically critical for the Anopheles male swarming and mating activities. However, little is known about the impact of local nectar feeding on male physiological development and its consequences on male mosquito life traits in the malaria control context. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of local fruit juices on the life traits of males Anopheles coluzzii. Methods: Swarming characteristics (number of males in swarm, number of mating pairs, and swarm duration) in semi-field conditions; mating rate and longevity in a laboratory setting were compared between males An. coluzzii fed exclusively with mango, papaya or banana juices. The trophic preference was investigated in semi-field conditions. Results: The results of this study showed that in the laboratory, mosquitoes fed with papaya juices lived on average longer (10 days) than those fed with banana or mango juices (5 days) and had higher a mating rate (53\%) than those fed with banana juice (40\%). In the semi-field, the swarm size of mosquitoes fed with banana juice (85 males) was larger than that of mosquitoes fed with mango juice (60 males). The number of mating pairs formed from banana-fed male swarms (17 mating pairs) was higher than that formed from mango-fed male swarm (8 mating pairs). There was no difference in swarming duration between male treatments. Male mosquitoes had a preference for papaya and banana juices. Conclusions: The results indicate that the origin of plant-derived feeding is an important factor in the survival and reproduction of mosquitoes. This calls for further investigations of chemical contents of nectars and their impact on the physiological development of mosquitoes.},

  abstract = {AbstractBackgroundSpeed and distance traveled provide quantifiable links between behavior and energetics, and are among the metrics most routinely estimated from animal tracking data. Researchers typically sum over the straight-line displacements (SLDs) between sampled locations to quantify distance traveled, while speed is estimated by dividing these displacements by time. Problematically, this approach is highly sensitive to the measurement scale, with biases subject to the sampling frequency, the tortuosity of the animal's movement, and the amount of measurement error. Compounding the issue of scale-sensitivity, SLD estimates do not come equipped with confidence intervals to quantify their uncertainty.MethodsTo overcome the limitations of SLD estimation, we outline a continuous-time speed and distance (CTSD) estimation method. An inherent property of working in continuous-time is the ability to separate the underlying continuous-time movement process from the discrete-time sampling process, making these models less sensitive to the sampling schedule when estimating parameters. The first step of CTSD is to estimate the device's error parameters to calibrate the measurement error. Once the errors have been calibrated, model selection techniques are employed to identify the best fit continuous-time movement model for the data. A simulation-based approach is then employed to sample from the distribution of trajectories conditional on the data, from which the mean speed estimate and its confidence intervals can be extracted.ResultsUsing simulated data, we demonstrate how CTSD provides accurate, scale-insensitive estimates with reliable confidence intervals. When applied to empirical GPS data, we found that SLD estimates varied substantially with sampling frequency, whereas CTSD provided relatively consistent estimates, with often dramatic improvements over SLD.ConclusionsThe methods described in this study allow for the computationally efficient, scale-insensitive estimation of speed and distance traveled, without biases due to the sampling frequency, the tortuosity of the animal's movement, or the amount of measurement error. In addition to being robust to the sampling schedule, the point estimates come equipped with confidence intervals, permitting formal statistical inference.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Separating males and females at the early adult stage did not ensure the virginity of females of Anopheles arabiensis (Dongola laboratory strain), whereas two years earlier this method had been successful. In most mosquito species, newly emerged males and females are not able to mate successfully. For anopheline species, a period of 24 h post-emergence is generally required for the completion of sexual maturation, which in males includes a 180{$^\circ$} rotation of the genitalia. In this study, the possibility of an unusually shortened sexual maturity period in the laboratory-reared colony was investigated. METHODS: The effect of two different sex-separation methods on the virginity of females was tested: females separated as pupae or less than 16 h post-emergence were mated with males subjected to various doses of radiation. T-tests were performed to compare the two sex-separation methods. The rate of genitalia rotation was compared for laboratory-reared and wild males collected as pupae in Dongola, Sudan, and analysed by Z-tests. Spermatheca dissections were performed on females mated with laboratory-reared males to determine their insemination status. RESULTS: When the sex-separation was performed when adults were less than 16 h post-emergence, expected sterility was never reached for females mated with radio-sterilized males. Expected sterility was accomplished only when sexes were separated at the pupal stage. Observation of genitalia rotation showed that some males from the laboratory strain Dongola were able to successfully mate only 11 h after emergence and 42\% of the males had already completed rotation. A small proportion of the same age females were inseminated. Wild males showed a much slower genitalia rotation rate. At 17 h post-emergence, 96\% of the laboratory-reared males had completed genitalia rotation whereas none of the wild males had. CONCLUSION: This colony has been cultured in the laboratory for over one hundred generations, and now has accelerated sexual maturation when compared with the wild strain. This outcome demonstrates the kinds of selection that can be expected during insect colonization and maintenance, particularly when generations are non-overlapping and similar-age males must compete for mates.},

  abstract = {Swarming behaviours in animals have been extensively studied owing to their implications for the evolution of cooperation, social cognition and predator--prey dynamics. An important goal of these studies is discerning which evolutionary pressures favour the formation of swarms. One hypothesis is that swarms arise because the presence of multiple moving prey in swarms causes confusion for attacking predators, but it remains unclear how important this selective force is. Using an evolutionary model of a predator--prey system, we show that predator confusion provides a sufficient selection pressure to evolve swarming behaviour in prey. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the evolutionary effect of predator confusion on prey could in turn exert pressure on the structure of the predator's visual field, favouring the frontally oriented, high-resolution visual systems commonly observed in predators that feed on swarming animals. Finally, we provide evidence that when prey evolve swarming in response to predator confusion, there is a change in the shape of the functional response curve describing the predator's consumption rate as prey density increases. Thus, we show that a relatively simple perceptual constraint---predator confusion---could have pervasive evolutionary effects on prey behaviour, predator sensory mechanisms and the ecological interactions between predators and prey.},

Monitoring vector resistance is paramount in order to understand its evolution and devise effective counter-solutions. In this study, we monitored insecticide resistance patterns, vector population bionomics and genetic variants associated with resistance over 3 years from 2021 to 2023 in Uganda.               Anopheles funestus s.s               was the predominant species in Mayuge but with evidence of hybridization with other species of the               An. funestus               group. Sporozoite infection rates were relatively very high with a peak of 20.41\% in March 2022. Intense pyrethroid resistance was seen against pyrethroids up to 10-times the diagnostic concentration but partial recovery of susceptibility in PBO synergistic assays. Among bednets, only PBO-based nets (PermaNet 3.0 Top and Olyset Plus) and chlorfenapyr-based net (Interceptor G2) had high mortality rates. Mosquitoes were fully susceptible to chlorfenapyr and organophosphates, moderately resistant to clothianidin and resistant to carbamates. The allele frequency of key P450, CYP9K1, resistance marker was constantly very high but that for CYP6P9A/b were very low. Interestingly, we report the first detection of resistance alleles for Ace1 gene (RS\,=\,\,{\textasciitilde}\,13\%) and Rdl gene (RS\,=\,\,{\textasciitilde}\,21\%, RR\,=\,\,{\textasciitilde}\,4\%) in Uganda. The qRT-PCR revealed that Cytochrome P450s CYP9K1, CYP6P9A, CYP6P9b, CYP6P5 and CYP6M7 were consistently upregulated while a glutathione-S-transferase gene (GSTE2) showed low expression. Our study shows the complexity of insecticide resistance patterns and underlying mechanisms, hence constant and consistent spatial and temporal monitoring is crucial to rapidly detect changing resistance profiles which is key in informing deployment of counter interventions.},

Among               Anopheles               mosquito species, these phenotypic differences include vectorial capacity, as it is only females that blood feed and thus transmit human malaria. Here, we use RNA-seq data from multiple tissues of four vector species spanning the               Anopheles               phylogeny to explore the genomic and evolutionary properties of sex-biased genes. We find that, in these mosquitoes, in contrast to what has been found in many other organisms, female-biased genes are more rapidly evolving in sequence, expression, and genic turnover than male-biased genes. Our results suggest that this atypical pattern may be due to the combination of sex-specific life history challenges encountered by females, such as blood feeding. Furthermore, female propensity to mate only once in nature in male swarms likely diminishes sexual selection of post-reproductive traits related to sperm competition among males. We also develop a comparative framework to systematically explore tissue- and sex-specific splicing to document its conservation throughout the genus and identify a set of candidate genes for future functional analyses of sex-specific isoform usage. Finally, our data reveal that the deficit of male-biased genes on the X Chromosomes in               Anopheles               is a conserved feature in this genus and can be directly attributed to chromosome-wide transcriptional regulation that de-masculinizes the X in male reproductive tissues.},

  abstract = {▪ Abstract{\enspace} Effective indoor residual spraying against malaria vectors depends on whether mosquitoes rest indoors (i.e., endophilic behavior). This varies among species and is affected by insecticidal irritancy. Exophilic behavior has evolved in certain populations exposed to prolonged spraying programs. Optimum effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets presumably depends on vectors biting at hours when most people are in bed. Time of biting varies among different malaria vector species, but so far there is inconclusive evidence for these evolving so as to avoid bednets. Use of an untreated net diverts extra biting to someone in the same room who is without a net. Understanding choice of oviposition sites and dispersal behavior is important for the design of successful larval control programs including those using predatory mosquito larvae. Prospects for genetic control by sterile males or genes rendering mosquitoes harmless to humans will depend on competitive mating behavior. These methods are hampered by the immigration of monogamous, already-mated females.},

Understanding and controlling vectors requires accurate information about their movement and activity, which is often lacking. The Photonic Fence (PF) is an optical system that uses machine vision, infrared light, and lasers to identify, track, and interdict vectors in flight. The PF examines an insect's outline, flight speed, and other flight parameters and if these match those of a targeted vector species, then a low-power, retina-safe laser kills it. We report on proof-of-concept tests of a large, field-sized PF (30~mL\,{\texttimes}\,3~mH) conducted with               Aedes aegypti               , a mosquito that transmits dangerous arboviruses, and               Diaphorina citri               , a psyllid which transmits the fatal huanglongbing disease of citrus.

  abstract = {Background: Mating swarm segregation in closely related insect species may contribute to reproductive isolation. Visual markers are used for swarm formation; however, it is unknown whether they play a key role in swarm location, species segregation and sex aggregation. Methods: Using two sympatric closely related species of the Anopheles gambiae complex, An. coluzzii and An. gambiae (s.s.), we investigated in both laboratory and semi-field conditions (i) whether males of the two species use visual markers (black cloths) to locate their swarm; and (ii) whether the presence/absence and size of the marker may differentially affect swarm characteristics. We also investigated whether conspecific virgin females use these markers to join male swarm sites. Results: We showed that males of the two species used visual markers but in different ways: An. coluzzii swarm right above the marker whereas An. gambiae (s.s.) locate their swarm at a constant distance of 76.4 {\textpm} 0.6 cm from a 20 {\texttimes} 20 cm marker in the laboratory setup and at 206 {\textpm} 6 cm from a 60 {\texttimes} 60 cm marker in the semi-field setup. Although increased marker size recruited more mosquitoes and consequently increased the swarm size in the two species, An. coluzzii swarms flew higher and were stretched both vertically and horizontally, while An. gambiae (s.s.) swarms were only stretched horizontally. Virgin females displayed a swarm-like behavior with similar characteristics to their conspecific males. Conclusions: Our results provided experimental evidence that both An. coluzzii and An. gambiae (s.s.) males use ground visual markers to form and locate their swarm at species-specific locations. Moreover, the marker size differentially affected swarm characteristics in the two species. Our results also showed that virgin females displayed a swarm-like behavior. However, these ``swarms'' could be due to the absence of males in our experimental conditions. Nevertheless, the fact that females displayed these ``swarms'' with the same characteristics as their respective males provided evidence that visual markers are used by the two sexes to join mating spots. Altogether, this suggests that visual markers and the way species and sexes use them could be key cues in species segregation, swarm location and recognition.},

We characterized three-dimensional spatiotemporal flight kinematics of Anopheles coluzzii males swarming at sunset above a ground marker. The location, shape, and volume of swarms were highly stereotypic, consistent over the complete swarming duration. Swarms have an elliptical cone shape; mean flight kinematics varies spatially within the swarm, but remain rather consistent throughout swarming duration. Using a sensory system-informed model, we show that swarming mosquitoes use visual perception of both the ground marker and sunset horizon to display the swarming behavior. To control their height, swarming individuals maintain an optical angle of the marker ranging from 24 to 55 . Limiting the viewing angle deviation to 4.5\% of the maximum value results in the observed elliptical cone swarm shape. We discuss the implications of these finding on malaria mosquito mating success, speciation and for vector control.},

More recently, rapid evolution of the diapause response has been implicated in response to contemporary global warming and during the range expansion of invasive species. Although the molecular regulation of diapause remains largely unresolved, rapidly emerging next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies provide exciting opportunities for addressing this longstanding question. In the present study, a new assembly from life-history stages relevant to diapause in the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus (Skuse) is reported, along with unique methods for the analysis of NGS data and transcriptome assembly. A digital normalization procedure that significantly reduces the computational resources required for transcriptome assembly is evaluated. Additionally, a method for protein reference-based and genomic reference-based merged assembly of 454 and Illumina reads is described. Finally, a gene ontology analysis is presented, which creates a platform for identifying the physiological processes associated with diapause.

In An. gambiae, the proportions of the two cuticular hydrocarbon components, n-heneicosane and n-tricosane, were signi{\TH}cantly reduced as the female aged and after it mated. There were no changes in the hydrocarbon composition of males after they mated. Hydrocarbon extracts from mated and unmated An. gambiae females as well as those from males caused a reduction in the rates of female insemination when they were applied to unmated females.

Since Marey and Muybridge's work, technical constraints have been the largest limitation to motion capture and analysis, which, in turn, limited what kinds of questions biologists could ask or answer. Throughout the history of our field, conceptual leaps and significant technical advances have generally worked hand in hand. Recently, high-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) motion data have become easier to acquire, providing new opportunities for comparative biomechanics. We describe how adding a third dimension of information has fuelled major paradigm shifts, not only leading to a reinterpretation of long-standing scientific questions but also allowing new questions to be asked. In this paper, we highlight recent work published in Journal of Experimental Biology and influenced by these studies, demonstrating the biological breakthroughs made with 3D data. Although amazing opportunities emerge from these technical and conceptual advances, high-resolution data often come with a price. Here, we discuss challenges of 3D data, including low-throughput methodology, costly equipment, low sample sizes, and complex analyses and presentation. Therefore, we propose guidelines for how and when to pursue 3D high-resolution data. We also suggest research areas that are poised for major new biological advances through emerging 3D data collection.},

The influence of environmental cues on the swarm morphology decays on a similar scale. Our results provide a strong constraint on how rapidly swarm models must produce collective states. But our findings support the feasibility of using swarms as a design template for multi-agent systems, because self-organized states are possible even with few agents.},

  abstract = {Mosquito-borne diseases account for around one million deaths annually. There is a constant need for novel intervention mechanisms to mitigate transmission, especially as current insecticidal methods become less effective with the rise of insecticide resistance among mosquito populations. Previously, we used a near infra-red tracking system to describe the behaviour of mosquitoes at a human-occupied bed net, work that eventually led to an entirely novel bed net design. Advancing that approach, here we report on the use of trajectory analysis of a mosquito flight, using machine learning methods. This largely unexplored application has significant potential for providing useful insights into the behaviour of mosquitoes and other insects. In this work, a novel methodology applies anomaly detection to distinguish male mosquito tracks from females and couples. The proposed pipeline uses new feature engineering techniques and splits each track into segments such that detailed flight behaviour differences influence the classifier rather than the experimental constraints such as the field of view of the tracking system. Each segment is individually classified and the outcomes are combined to classify whole tracks. By interpreting the model using SHAP values, the features of flight that contribute to the differences between sexes are found and are explained by expert opinion. This methodology was tested using 3D tracks generated from mosquito mating swarms in the field and obtained a balanced accuracy of 64.5\% and an ROC AUC score of 68.4\%. Such a system can be used in a wide variety of trajectory domains to detect and analyse the behaviours of different classes, e.g., sex, strain, and species. The results of this study can support genetic mosquito control interventions for which mating represents a key event for their success.},

  abstract = {For insects, finding of a mate or a food source relies often chiefly on olfactory information. The identification of a specific mate or host involves the recognition of a specific odor blend and its discrimination from a complex and changing background. Their highly efficient olfactory systems have evolved to detect behaviorally relevant compounds with a high sensitivity and properly decode the olfactory message to finally lead to adapted behaviors (Martin et al. 2011). Moth sex pheromones, for instance, are precisely defined blends that trigger innate and stable behavioral responses in physiologically competent individuals. We begin this chapter with a description of the general organization of the insect olfactory system from the olfactory organs to the brain (Section 2.2). We will then consider the neuronal bases of the coding of pheromone and general odors (Section 2.3). The chemical specificity of the detection is at first based on the specificity of olfactory receptors (ORs) expressed in precise types of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) to detect individual compounds. But to insects as to other organisms, biologically relevant odors are often blends of volatile compounds whose perception involves progressive integration of the input in the central nervous system (CNS). In the wild, different sources release their volatiles simultaneously and their components intermingle to form a complex and fluctuating olfactory environment. Interactions between odor components, or their resulting neural codes, take place at the different levels of the sensory system and are intrinsic to olfaction. Section 2.4 will consider how insects recognize odor multicomponent blends in such chemical complexity. To be pertinent, the response of insects to odors must integrate the physiological and sensory contexts. Even strongly determined odor-guided behaviors are modulated by underlying changes in the internal physiological state of the animal and many behaviors are multimodal (Section 2.5). Very often chemical signals vary in an unpredictable way for the receiver and the chemical environment in which the signal is released is rather complex and changing. Previous experiences also modify the processing of odor signals and the associated behavioral responses. In the last section (Section 2.6), we consider the processing of olfactory signals under the influences of the ecological context and the individual history. Outstanding progress in our understanding of insect olfaction has been accomplished through numerous experimental studies conducted in parallel on several model species, like bees, flies, or moths with their specificities. Although belonging to quite different groups, with diversity in their biology and phylogenetical origin, these model species share many of the general traits of organization of their olfactory system. However, making a synthesis would have been impossible due to the abundance of the literature and the risks of raising specific adaptations to general facts. I arbitrarily chose to focus this chapter on moths. Reproduction in that nocturnal Lepidoptera offers the advantage of providing cases for a highly determined sex pheromone communication system, and a more plastic use of olfaction for feeding and oviposition. Thus, most of the examples herein have been taken from moths and completed by data collected from other classical model insect species when relevant.},

  abstract = {Background: As ectothermic animals, temperature influences insects in almost every aspect. The potential disease spreading Asian bush mosquito (Aedes japonicus japonicus) is native to temperate East Asia but invasive in several parts of the world. We report on the previously poorly understood temperature-dependence of its life history under laboratory conditions to understand invasion processes and to model temperature niches. Results: To evaluate winter survival, eggs were exposed between 1 day and 14 days to low temperatures (5 {$^\circ$}C, 0 {$^\circ$}C, -5 {$^\circ$}C and -9 {$^\circ$}C). Hatching success was drastically decreased after exposure to 0 {$^\circ$}C and -5 {$^\circ$}C, and the minimal hatching success of 0\% was reached at -9 {$^\circ$}C after two days. We then exposed larvae to 14 temperatures and assessed their life trait parameters. Larval survival to adulthood was only possible between 10 {$^\circ$}C and 31 {$^\circ$}C. Based on this, we modelled the optimal (25 {$^\circ$}C), minimal (7 {$^\circ$}C) and maximal (31 {$^\circ$}C) temperature for cumulative female survival. The time to adult emergence ranges from 12 days to 58 days depending on temperature. We used an age-atemergence-temperature model to calculate the number of potential generations per year for the Asian bush mosquito in Germany with an average of 4.72 potential generations. At lower temperatures, individuals grew larger than at higher temperatures with female R1 length ranging from 3.04 {\textpm} 0.1 mm at 31 {$^\circ$}C to 4.26 {\textpm} 0.2 mm at 15 {$^\circ$}C. Conclusions: Reduced egg hatch after exposure to sub-zero temperatures prohibits the establishment of the Asian bush mosquito in large parts of Germany. Larval overwintering is not possible at temperature {$\leq$} 5 {$^\circ$}C. The many potential generations displayed per year may contribute to the species' invasion success. This study on the thermal ecology of the Asian bush mosquito adds to our knowledge on the temperature dependence of the species and data could be incorporated in epidemiological and population dynamic modelling.},

Here key observations from this 3D-video tracking study are reproduced by a minimally structured (maximum entropy) stochastic trajectory model. The modelling shows that in contrast with midge swarms which are a form of collective behavior, unperturbed mosquito swarms are more like collections of individuals that independently circulate around a fixed location. The modelling predicts the observed response Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes in wild swarms to varying wind speeds (Butail et al. in J Med Entomol 50(3): 552--559, 2013). It is shown that this response can be attributed to shear hardening. This is because mosquitoes are found to be attracted to the centre of the swarm by an effective force that increases with increasing flight speed. Mosquitoes can therefore better resist the influence of environmental disturbances by increasing their flight speeds. This contrasts with other emergent mechanical-like properties of swarming which arise accidentally without a change in an individual's behavior. The new results add to the growing realization that perturbations can drive swarms into more robust states.},

The findings are significant because they demonstrate the surprising efficacy of classical equilibrium thermodynamics for quantitatively characterizing and predicting collective behaviour in biology. Nonetheless, the equation of state obtained by Sinhuber et al. (2021) is anomalous, lacking a physical analogue, making its' interpretation problematic. Moreover, the dynamical processes underlying the thermodynamic cycling were not identified. Here I show that insect swarms are equally well represented as van der Waals gases and I attribute the possibility of thermodynamic cycling to insect swarms consisting of several overlapping sublayers. This brings about a profound change in the understanding of laboratory swarms which until now have been regarded as consisting of non-interacting individuals and lacking any internal structure. I show how the effective interactions can be attributed to the swarms' internal structure, the external perturbations and to the presence of intrinsic noise. I thereby show that intrinsic noise which is known to be crucial for the emergence of the macroscopic mechanical properties of insect swarms is also crucial for the emergence of their thermodynamic properties as encapsulated by their equation of state.},

In recent years, much progress has been made in uncovering the emergent mechanical-like and thermodynamic-like of such swarms. Nonetheless, two basic properties of this swarming behaviour remain unexplained. Namely, why do individual insects have erratic rather than regular flight patterns? And why are the swarms elliptical rather than circular? Here I account for this seemingly undue complexity. I show that regular flight patterns weaken an individual's attraction to the swarm centre, making swarms less resilient to the presence of environmental disturbances. I then show that the elliptical shape of swarms of the non-biting midge Chironomus riparius optimizes the trade-off between maximizing swarm size (target size for females) and maximizing swarm stability. Finally, I show that the observed excess velocity kurtosis of swarming C. riparius maximizes swarm cohesiveness. Taken together the new results provide the first tentative evidence for fine-tuning in insect mating swarms driven by selection pressure for advantageous behaviours.},

  abstract = {Culex pipiens L. reared under diapause-inducing conditions (short daylength; 18 C) were more cold tolerant and desiccation resistant than their nondiapausing counterparts (long daylength; 18 C). Upon cold exposure ( 5 C), diapausing mosquitoes reared at 18 C survived nearly twice as long as nondiapausing mosquitoes reared at 18 C and 10 times longer than nondiapausing mosquitoes reared at 25 C. Thus, rearing temperature provided partial protection against low temperature injury in nondiapausing mosquitoes, but maximum resistance to cold was attained by the diapause state. In this species, the supercooling point is not a good indicator of cold tolerance. Both diapausing and nondiapausing females had supercooling points of approximately 16 C, but diapausing as well as nondiapausing females died at temperatures well above the supercooling point, suggesting that low temperature mortality was due to indirect chilling injury. Diapause also conferred greater resistance to desiccation (1.6 {\DH}2-fold increase in survival) compared with the nondiapause state. The gene encoding a 70-kDa heat shock protein, hsp70, was not up-regulated (i.e., more highly expressed) as a part of the diapause program, nor was it up-regulated by desiccation stress, but it was up-regulated during recovery from cold shock. Cx. pipiens thus differs from a number of other diapausing insect species that are known to developmentally up-regulate hsp70 during diapause.},

  abstract = {Institutional and federal ethics committees regulate research on live vertebrate animals. Current regulations require researchers to provide environmental enrichment for laboratory animals. The intention is that such enrichment reduces stress and prevents atypical behavior of captive animals, enhancing the ethical treatment of these individuals, as well as providing more robust scientific results. Enrichment can take various forms but most frequently mimics aspects of the animal's natural environment, such as the inclusion of plant life, shelters, conspecifics, or providing challenges to keep the animals occupied. These approaches have proven effective for mammals and birds; however, we know little about the effectiveness of environmental enrichment for other common research taxa, such as reptiles and amphibians. These taxa are more phylogenetically distant from humans, making intuition an unreliable guide upon which to base decisions about ethics best practice, including the benefits of environmental enrichment. The eastern fence lizard, Sceloporus undulatus, spends much of its time off the ground. Therefore, we provided climbing enrichment to captive fence lizards to allow them the opportunity to carry out this common natural behavior in captivity, and tested its effect on a range of ecologic- and scientifically relevant physiological and behavioral parameters. The provision of environmental enrichment, in the form of raised basking platforms, did not affect survival (P = 0.25), baseline levels of plasma corticosterone (an indicator of physiological stress; P = 0.81), activity (P = 0.19), basking behavior (P = 0.89), time spent hiding (P = 0.59), growth (mass: P = 0.44; snout-vent length: P = 0.47), or overall body condition of these lizards (P = 0.61). This lack of an effect highlights the need for researchers to objectively test the effectiveness of enrichment, rather than relying on subjectivity and anthropomorphism when making decisions about their use.},

This is thought to select for organisms to regulate their temporal biology accordingly, through circadian and diel rhythms. In addition to rhythms in abiotic factors (such as light and temperature), biotic factors, including ecological interactions, also follow daily cycles. How daily rhythms shape, and are shaped by, interactions between organisms is poorly understood. Here, we review an emerging area, namely the causes and consequences of daily rhythms in the interactions between vectors, their hosts and the parasites they transmit. We focus on mosquitoes, malaria parasites and vertebrate hosts, because this system offers the opportunity to integrate from genetic and molecular mechanisms to population dynamics and because disrupting rhythms offers a novel avenue for disease control.},

  abstract = {Anopheles gambiae               , the primary African vector of malaria parasites, exhibits numerous rhythmic behaviors including flight activity, swarming, mating, host seeking, egg laying, and sugar feeding. However, little work has been performed to elucidate the molecular basis for these daily rhythms. To study how gene expression is regulated globally by diel and circadian mechanisms, we have undertaken a DNA microarray analysis of               An. gambiae               under light/dark cycle (LD) and constant dark (DD) conditions. Adult mated, non--blood-fed female mosquitoes were collected every 4 h for 48 h, and samples were processed with DNA microarrays. Using a cosine wave-fitting algorithm, we identified 1,293 and 600 rhythmic genes with a period length of 20--28 h in the head and body, respectively, under LD conditions, representing 9.7 and 4.5\% of the               An. gambiae               gene set. A majority of these genes was specific to heads or bodies. Examination of mosquitoes under DD conditions revealed that rhythmic programming of the transcriptome is dependent on an interaction between the endogenous clock and extrinsic regulation by the LD cycle. A subset of genes, including the canonical clock components, was expressed rhythmically under both environmental conditions. A majority of genes had peak expression clustered around the day/night transitions, anticipating dawn and dusk. Genes cover diverse biological processes such as transcription/translation, metabolism, detoxification, olfaction, vision, cuticle regulation, and immunity, and include rate-limiting steps in the pathways. This study highlights the fundamental roles that both the circadian clock and light play in the physiology of this important insect vector and suggests targets for intervention.                        ,              AUTHOR SUMMARY                            Our work in the               An. gambiae               mosquito reveals rhythmic expression of numerous genes across several biological categories. An improved understanding of the rhythmic nature of mosquito biochemistry, physiology, and behavior, including sensory perception and susceptibilities to insecticide or immune challenge, will provide opportunities for novel malarial control strategies and optimization of existing approaches. Indeed, insight into biological timing at the molecular level may prove to be key in the successful implementation of control methods and future experimental design.                                         A number of genes involved in immunity, primarily in the immune deficiency and melanization pathways, show rhythmic expression profiles suggesting time-of-day--specific susceptibility to infection in               An. gambiae               . The melanization response encapsulates both bacteria and               Plasmodium               parasites and produces toxic antimicrobial by-products. Because a circadian rhythm of susceptibility to bacterial infection in               Drosophila               has been demonstrated recently (               5               ), our results suggest that time-of-day--specific effects should be considered when developing biopesticide-based interventions for               An. gambiae               .                                         The mosquito uses olfaction to detect blood-feeding hosts and nectar and to select oviposition sites (               1               ). We identified rhythmic expression of olfaction genes dominated by odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) (               Fig. P1               ). OBPs are soluble proteins located in the olfactory sensilla and are thought to transport odor molecules through the mucous layer to the olfactory receptors, thereby facilitating their activation. Our data indicate that daily changes in OBP levels may modify the olfactory system's sensitivity to specific odors. Interestingly, the OBP genes oscillate with concordant peak phases occurring at dusk or during the early night. It is plausible that these cycles lead to increased sensitivity of the system coinciding with the time of nocturnal host- and nectar-seeking behavior (               1               ). The odorant coreceptor,               OR7               , which is the heterodimer required for all odorant receptor transduction, also was rhythmic in the head, peaking at a time similar to the rhythms of OBP genes near the end of the light phase (               Fig. P1               ). Rhythmicity of OR7 could prove to be another potential gate for diel control of olfactory sensitivity and is especially interesting because it has been implicated in the detection of the insect repellent N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET). Our analysis also identified rhythmically expressed genes of the visual system, including those contributing to rhodopsin biogenesis and to the phototransduction cascade. Phase-concordant relationships in gene expression between specific partner proteins might contribute to a time-of-day--specific gating mechanism for tuning sensitivity to light. Such temporal changes in sensitivity to light have been reported in other insect species.                                         Our analysis revealed detoxification genes to be rhythmic, including as much as a third of the               An. gambiae               cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase (P450) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes. These genes include               CYP6Z1               ,               agCYP6P3               ,               agCYP6M2               , and               GSTE2               , whose up-regulation is implicated in insecticide resistance (               Fig. P1               ) (               4               ). These data highlight the likelihood that               An. gambiae               exhibits rhythmic sensitivity to insecticides, as has been observed in other insects including               Aedes               mosquitoes. This finding is important for maximizing exposure of the mosquito to insecticides at the time of day when they may be most susceptible.                                         We identify biological processes whose underlying gene expression is under rhythmic control in               An. gambiae               and highlight those that may be important in considering measures of insect control. Metabolic demands in the mosquito vary drastically between rest and flight activity. Moreover, in               An. gambiae               sugar and blood feeding is restricted to the night phase (               1               ). With these predictable temporal changes in respiratory demands and nutrient availability, it is no surprise that many steps in anabolic/catabolic metabolic pathways were identified as under rhythmic control. Genes under rhythmic control include those involved in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid oxidation pathways. Also, genes associated with control of intermediary metabolism and feeding, nutritional homeostasis, and nutrient mobilization were found to be rhythmic. These genes include               target of rapamycin               and the               takeout               genes, which are components of nutrient-sensing signaling pathways and are capable of modulating temporal aspects of feeding behavior. Our data indicate that metabolic activity in               An. gambiae               is coordinated temporally, allowing the mosquito to anticipate the differing energy demands of activity/rest and the variations in anabolic/catabolic states that occur across the 24-h period.                                         Eukaryotic organisms possess a molecular circadian clock comprising a series of transcriptional--translational feedback loops whose completion takes {$\sim$}24 h. The organization of the clock and several of the genes involved are similar across taxonomic groups. In our study of               An. gambiae               , examination of clock genes revealed the presence of characteristic phase-specific rhythms, such as observed in other mosquito species and in               Drosophila               (               Fig. P1               ) (               2               ,               3               ). Consistent with recent studies on               Aedes               and               Culex               mosquitoes, but dissimilar to               Drosophila               , the transcriptional repressor and component of the negative feedback loop,               cryptochrome 2               (               CRY2               ), was found to be expressed rhythmically in               An. gambiae               , whereas the               cryptochrome 1               gene, encoding a photoreceptor of the clock, was found to be expressed constitutively. These data demonstrate that the               An. gambiae               circadian system, as well as that of other mosquito species, resembles other insects (e.g., butterfly) more closely than its fellow Dipteran and genetic model organism,               Drosophila               . Genes regulated by the clock are described as ``clock-controlled genes,'' and their rhythms in expression are generated by episodic activation/suppression of their promoters, either directly by canonical clock components or via downstream intermediaries. However, an important finding from our analysis in               An. gambiae               is that the overlap in genes rhythmically expressed under both LD and DD conditions is limited to {$\sim$}60\%. This incomplete overlap suggests that the               An. gambiae               24-h rhythm-generating system comprises two distinct but interlocking mechanisms, one reliant on signals directly from the environmental LD cycle and the other on signals generated internally by the endogenous circadian clock, together forming a bimodal system as similarly proposed for               Drosophila               (               3               ). Downstream of this diel and circadian regulation of transcription exist additional posttranscriptional processes. Our results in               An. gambiae               reveal rhythms in genes involved in gene splicing, translation, and aspects of protein degradation pathways, which could produce, enhance, or modify 24-h rhythms in gene expression and protein abundance.                                         To explore how gene expression is regulated globally in               An. gambiae               by diel mechanisms, processes directly driven by the environmental light/dark (LD) cycle, and by the endogenous circadian clock, we undertook a DNA microarray analysis of adult female mosquitoes sampled every 4 h over a 48-h period under both LD and constant dark (DD) conditions. This transcriptional analysis of               An. gambiae               rhythms allows a detailed exploration of the extent to which mosquito biochemistry, physiology, and behavior are controlled by diel and circadian mechanisms (               Fig. P1               ). We sought to characterize the molecular rhythms underlying overt rhythms already documented and to identify hitherto unknown rhythms as have been revealed in model genetic species. With the use of stringent criteria for identifying rhythmic gene-expression profiles, 2,095 genes accounting for at least 15.8\% of the               An. gambiae               gene set were discovered to be rhythmic in either the mosquito head or body and under diel and/or circadian control. In many cases, genes were expressed rhythmically specifically in either the head or the body; these genes covered a wide range of biological functions and processes (               Fig. P1               ).                                         The mosquito               Anopheles gambiae               is the major African vector of malaria parasites. Thus far, malaria transmission has been controlled primarily through insect-management strategies. Like all animals, mosquitoes show daily rhythms in behavior and physiology (               1               ); in               An. gambiae               these rhythms include dusk mating swarms and nocturnal flight activity (               Fig. P1               ), feeding on sugar and on blood-meal hosts, and egg laying. To combat diseases such as malaria, basic understanding of the biology of mosquito vector species is critical to identify novel methods for intervening in transmission, to interpret past experiments, and to design future ones.},

  abstract = {Anopheles gambiae, the primary African malaria vector, is currently speciating into two incipient species, the so-called ``molecular forms'' M and S. While some geographic areas may contain only one form, in many areas both forms are found coexisting, but reproductively isolated. It appears that spatial segregation of mating swarms may contribute significantly to reproductive isolation as in many locales single-form swarms exist almost exclusively even though they are in close geographic proximity. The mechanism causing this spatial segregation is not well understood. Here, we compare the locomotor flight activity of M and S form male and female An. gambiae mosquitoes with the goal of identifying potential strain-specific temporal differences that could potentially serve as a mating barrier. We use an infrared beam break method to monitor flight activity of individual mosquitoes with a minute-tominute time resolution under both LD cycle and constant dark conditions. We compare daily total flight activity, activity onset, peak in early nocturnal activity, the build up of dusk-related activity, and the free-running circadian period length. Our investigations revealed strain- and sex-specific differences in total daily activity. In both forms, males commenced nightly flight activity earlier than females, and this corresponded with a significantly shorter circadian period length in males compared to females. We note strain-specific differences in this response to dusk as males of the M form have a pronounced build up in flight activity relative to the S form males prior to complete darkness. This is likely driven by a differential response to the decreasing light intensity at dusk. We hypothesize that this behavioral difference could be a temporal factor contributing to the assembly of single-form swarms.},

Methods               All available health systems data relevant for malaria control were collated from 23 online data repositories.

Results               There was large heterogeneity in progress in malaria control in the 2000--2016 period. In univariate analysis, several health systems factors displayed a strong positive correlation with reductions in malaria burden between 2000 and 2016. In multivariable models, delivery of routine services and hospital capacity were strongly predictive of reductions in malaria cases, especially in high burden countries. In low-burden countries approaching elimination, primary health center density appeared negatively associated with progress while hospital capacity was positively correlated with eliminating malaria.

  abstract = {Significance                            Transmission of malarial parasites occurs via the bites of               Anopheles               mosquitoes, whose blood-feeding behavior modulates the risk of infection. In many malaria endemic regions, eradication strategies rely on reducing transmission by targeting nocturnal blood-feeding               Anopheles               with insecticidal nets. However, a proportion of mosquitoes may naturally feed when humans are not protected by nets, setting a ceiling to the efficacy of massive net-based interventions. In Bangui, Central African Republic, 20 to 30\% of daily exposure to indoor bites occurs during daytime, and this fraction may correspond to mosquitoes escaping exposure to current vector control measures. Knowledge about the daily rhythmicity of mosquito biting is therefore crucial to adjust vector control tactics to protect people at places where they spend daytime.                        ,                             Malaria control interventions target nocturnal feeding of the               Anopheles               vectors indoors to reduce parasite transmission. Mass deployment of insecticidal bed nets and indoor residual spraying with insecticides, however, may induce mosquitoes to blood-feed at places and at times when humans are not protected. These changes can set a ceiling to the efficacy of these control interventions, resulting in residual malaria transmission. Despite its relevance for disease transmission, the daily rhythmicity of               Anopheles               biting behavior is poorly documented, most investigations focusing on crepuscular hours and nighttime. By performing mosquito collections 48-h around the clock, both indoors and outdoors, and by modeling biting events using circular statistics, we evaluated the full daily rhythmicity of biting in urban Bangui, Central African Republic.

As biting events did not fully conform to any family of circular distributions, we fitted mixtures of von Mises distributions and found that observations were consistent with three compartments, corresponding indoors to populations of early-night, late-night, and daytime-biting events. It is not known whether these populations of biting events correspond to spatiotemporal heterogeneities or also to distinct mosquito genotypes/phenotypes belonging consistently to each compartment. Prevalence of               Plasmodium falciparum               in nighttime- and daytime-biting mosquitoes was the same. As {$>$}50\% of biting occurs in Bangui when people are unprotected, malaria control interventions outside the domiciliary environment should be envisaged.},

  abstract = {Background The negative impacts of climate change on biodiversity are consistently increasing. Developmen-tal stages are particularly sensitive in many ectotherms. Moreover, sex-specific differences in how organisms cope with thermal stress can produce biased sex ratios upon emergence, with potentially major impacts on population persistence. This is an issue that needs investigation, particularly testing whether thermal selection can alleviate sex ratio distortions in the long-term is a critical but neglected issue. Here, we report an experiment analyzing the sex ratio patterns at different developmental temperatures in Drosophila subobscura populations subjected to long-term experimental evolution ({\textasciitilde} 30 generations) under a warming environment. Results We show that exposure to high developmental temperatures consistently promotes sex ratio imbalance upon emergence, with a higher number of female than male offspring. Furthermore, we found that thermal selec-tion resulting from evolution in a warming environment did not alleviate such sex ratio distortions generated by heat stress. Conclusions We demonstrate that heat stress during development can lead to clear sex ratio deviations upon emer-gence likely because of differential survival between sexes. In face of these findings, it is likely that sex ratio devia-tions of this sort occur in natural populations when facing environmental perturbation. The inability of many insects to avoid thermal shifts during their (more) sessile developmental stages makes this finding particularly troublesome for population subsistence in face of climate warming events.},

  abstract = {Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases of humans. It is problematic clinically and economically as it prevails in poorer countries and regions, strongly hindering socioeconomic development. The causative agents of malaria are unicellular protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Plasmodium. These parasites infect not only humans but also other vertebrates, from reptiles and birds to mammals. To date, over 200 species of Plasmodium have been formally described, and each species infects a certain range of hosts. Plasmodium species that naturally infect humans and cause malaria in large areas of the world are limited to five---P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi. The first four are specific for humans, while P. knowlesi is naturally maintained in macaque monkeys and causes zoonotic malaria widely in South East Asia. Transmission of Plasmodium species between vertebrate hosts depends on an insect vector, which is usually the mosquito. The vector is not just a carrier but the definitive host, where sexual reproduction of Plasmodium species occurs, and the parasite's development in the insect is essential for transmission to the next vertebrate host. The range of insect species that can support the critical development of Plasmodium depends on the individual parasite species, but all five Plasmodium species causing malaria in humans are transmitted exclusively by anopheline mosquitoes. Plasmodium species have remarkable genetic flexibility which lets them adapt to alterations in the environment, giving them the potential to quickly develop resistance to therapeutics such as antimalarials and to change host specificity. In this article, selected topics involving the Plasmodium species that cause malaria in humans are reviewed.},

Consequently, malaria elimination will not be achieved unless additional tools are found to deal with the residual malaria transmission and the associated vector dynamics. In this study we tested a new vector control approach for rapidly crashing mosquito populations and disrupting malaria transmission in Africa. This method targets the previously neglected swarming and outdoor nocturnal behaviors of both male and female               Anopheles               mosquitoes. It involved accurate identification and targeted spraying of mosquito swarms to suppress adult malaria vector populations and their vectorial capacities. The impact of targeted spraying was compared to broadcast spraying and evaluated simultaneously. The effects of the two interventions were very similar, no significant differences between targeted spraying and broadcast spraying were found for effects on density, insemination or parity rate. However, targeted spraying was found to be significantly more effective than broadcast spraying at reducing the number of bites per person. As expected, each intervention had a highly significant impact upon all parameters measured, but the targeted swarm spraying required less insecticide.},

  abstract = {Background: The M and S molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae s.s. Giles appear to have speciated in West Africa and the M form is now formally named An. coluzzii Coetzee \& Wilkerson sp.n. and the S form retains the nominotypical name (abbreviated here to An. gambiae). Reproductive isolation is thought to be the main barrier to hybridisation; even though both species are found in the same mating swarms, hybrid fertilisations in copulae have not been found in the study area. The aim of the study, therefore, was to determine whether differences in circadian and/or environmental control over the timing of swarming in the two species contribute to reproductive isolation. Methods: The timing of male swarming in these species was recorded four nights per month over four years at five swarming sites in each of two villages. The timing of the start and end of swarming, and the concurrent environmental parameters, temperature, humidity and light intensity, were recorded for n = 20 swarms/month/ species. The timing of `spontaneous' activity at dusk of individual An. coluzzii and An. gambiae males was videorecorded in an actograph outdoors for 21 nights. Results: Of the environmental parameters considered, swarming was most strongly correlated with sunset (r2 {$>$} 0.946). Anopheles gambiae started and stopped swarming earlier than An. coluzzii (3:35 {\textpm} 0:68 min:sec and 4:51 {\textpm} 1:21, respectively), and the mean duration of swarming was 23:37 {\textpm} 0:33 for An. gambiae and 21:39 {\textpm} 0:33 for An. coluzzii. Accordingly, in principle, whenever both species swarm over the same marker, a mean of 15.3 {\textpm} 3.1\% of An. gambiae swarming would occur before An. coluzzii males arrived, and 19.5 {\textpm} 4.55\% of An. coluzzii swarming would occurred after An. gambiae males had stopped swarming. These results are consistent with the finding that An. gambiae males became active in the actograph 09:35 {\textpm} 00:22 min:sec earlier than An. coluzzii males. Conclusions: The timing of swarming and spontaneous activity at dusk are primarily under circadian control, with the phase linked closely to sunset throughout the year. The mating activity of these two species is temporally segregated for 15-20\% of the swarming period, which may contribute to the observed reproductive isolation of these species in local sympatric populations.},

Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti are the incriminated vectors in the recent outbreaks of chikungunya and dengue fever in Europe. However, both laboratory experiments and field observations indicate that these invasive mosquitoes have a potential to also transmit other pathogens of public health importance. Increasing travel and pathogen introduction, expansion of vector distribution, and both environmental and climatic changes are likely to raise the risk of pathogen transmission by these invasive Aedes mosquitoes. Their vector status and their involvement in pathogen transmission are dynamic processes that shape the future of mosquito-borne disease epidemiology in Europe. Beside vector surveillance, enhanced disease surveillance will enable the early detection of cases and the prompt implementation of control measures.},

Empirical analysis of these behaviors in experiment or computational simulation primarily involves the use of "swarm-averaged" metrics or order parameters such as velocity alignment and angular momentum. Recently, tools from computational topology have been applied to the analysis of swarms to further understand and automate the detection of fundamentally different swarm structures evolving in space and time. Here, we show how the field of graph signal processing can be used to fuse these two approaches by collectively analyzing swarm properties using graph Fourier harmonics that respect the topological structure of the swarm. This graph Fourier analysis reveals hidden structure in a number of common swarming states and forms the basis of a flexible analysis framework for collective motion.},

In Sub-Saharan Africa, two major malaria vectors,               Anopheles gambiae               and               An. coluzzii               , breed in distinct larval habitats characterized by different microorganisms that might affect their adult physiology and possibly               Plasmodium               transmission. We analyzed the reproductive microbiomes of male and female               An. gambiae               and               An. coluzzii               couples collected from natural mating swarms in Burkina Faso. 16S rRNA sequencing on dissected tissues revealed that the reproductive tracts harbor a complex microbiome characterized by a large core group of bacteria shared by both species and all reproductive tissues. Interestingly, we detected a significant enrichment of several gender-associated microbial biomarkers in specific tissues, and surprisingly, similar classes of bacteria in males captured from one mating swarm, suggesting that these males originated from the same larval breeding site. Finally, we identified several endosymbiotic bacteria, including               Spiroplasma               , which have the ability to manipulate insect reproductive success. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the reproductive microbiome of important human disease vectors, and identifies a panel of core and endosymbiotic bacteria that can be potentially exploited to interfere with the transmission of malaria parasites by the               Anopheles               mosquito.},

To understand the magnitude of heterochromatin variation within the Anopheles gambiae complex of malaria mosquitoes, we analyzed metaphase chromosomes in An. arabiensis, An. coluzzii, An. gambiae, An. merus, and An. quadriannulatus. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with ribosomal DNA (rDNA), a highly repetitive fraction of DNA, and heterochromatic Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones, we established the correspondence of pericentric heterochromatin between the metaphase and polytene X chromosomes of An. gambiae. We then developed chromosome idiograms and demonstrated that the X chromosomes exhibit qualitative differences in their pattern of heterochromatic bands and position of satellite DNA (satDNA) repeats among the sibling species with postzygotic isolation, An. arabiensis, An. merus, An. quadriannulatus, and An. coluzzii or An. gambiae. The identified differences in the size and structure of the X chromosome heterochromatin point to a possible role of repetitive DNA in speciation of mosquitoes. We found that An. coluzzii and An. gambiae, incipient species with prezygotic isolation, share variations in the relative positions of the satDNA repeats and the proximal heterochromatin band on the X chromosomes. This previously unknown genetic polymorphism in malaria mosquitoes may be caused by a differential amplification of DNA repeats or an inversion in the sex chromosome heterochromatin.},

  abstract = {Lek mating systems are relatively rare but occur in a diverse taxonomic array of animals, including birds, mammals, anurans, and insects. Such systems exhibit four features: 1)males provide no parental care and supply only gametes; 2) males are spatially aggregated at mating arenas (or leks); 3) males do not control access to resources critical to females; and 4) females are free to select mates at the arena. Among insects, fruit flies of the families Tephritidae and Drosophilidae display lek behavior that closely resembles the `classic' lek mating systems of vertebrate species. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of empirical findings on lek-forming tephritid and drosophilid flies.The essay is organized around a series of 19 questions, the first six of which provide background information on fruit fly leks.These questions deal with the location, persistence, and size of leks as well as pheromonal attraction of females and the nature of male--male aggression. The remaining questions touch on broader issues that are common to the study of lekking species regardless of taxonomic affiliation. For example, these questions concern skewed mating distributions among males, male signals important in female choice, the importance of male aggression and signaling position in affecting male mating success, the possibility of male choice, costs to males associated with lek displays, and evidence of direct and indirect benefits to females resulting from mate selection etc. Reflecting data availability, emphasis is on precopulatory mate choice, sperm competition and female cryptic choice are briefly addressed.},

As the size of a flyer is reduced, the wing-to-body mass ratio tends to decrease as well. Furthermore, these flyers use integrated system consisting of wings to generate aerodynamic forces, muscles to move the wings, and sensing and control systems to guide and manoeuvre. In this article, recent advances in insect-scale flapping-wing aerodynamics, flexible wing structures, unsteady flight environment, sensing, stability and control are reviewed with perspective offered.

  abstract = {Anopheles merus can breed in a range of saltwater concentrations. The consequences of this ability on the life history of adult An. merus are poorly understood. This study examined the effects of exposure to 0, 2.1875, 4.375, 8.75, and 17.5 g/L of sodium chloride on An. merus. The effects on larval development, adult longevity, fertility, and fecundity, as well as deltamethrin tolerance were examined. The effect of larval salt exposure on the expression of defensin-1 in adults was examined by quantitative Real-Time PCR. Finally, the effect of the larval salt concentration on microbial dynamics was assessed by 16S Next Generation Sequencing. High concentrations of saltwater increased larval development time and number of eggs laid, as well as deltamethrin tolerance. Larval exposure to salt also reduced the expression of defensin-1. The exposure also had a significant effect on microbial diversity in larvae and adults. The diversity of larvae decreased once adults emerged. Salt-tolerant bacterial genera predominated in larvae but were absent in adults. High salt concentrations resulted in greater abundance of Plasmodium-protective genera in adults. Although this study was conducted on a laboratory strain of An. merus, these data suggest that osmoregulation has a significant effect on the life history of the species with potential epidemiological consequences.},

  abstract = {Significance                            In 2012, an unusual outbreak of malaria occurred in Djibouti City followed by increasingly severe annual outbreaks. Investigations revealed the presence of an Asian mosquito species;               Anopheles stephensi               , which thrives in urban environments.               An.               stephensi               has since been identified in Ethiopia and Sudan. By combining data for               An. stephensi               across its full range (Asia, Arabian Peninsula, Horn of Africa) with spatial models that identify the species' preferred habitat, we provide evidence-based maps predicting the possible African locations where               An. stephensi               could establish if allowed to spread. Our results suggest over 126 million people in cities across Africa could be at risk. This supports the WHO's call for targeted               An. stephensi               control and prioritized surveillance.                        ,                             In 2012, an unusual outbreak of urban malaria was reported from Djibouti City in the Horn of Africa and increasingly severe outbreaks have been reported annually ever since. Subsequent investigations discovered the presence of an Asian mosquito species;               Anopheles stephensi               , a species known to thrive in urban environments. Since that first report,               An. stephensi               has been identified in Ethiopia and Sudan, and this worrying development has prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to publish a vector alert calling for active mosquito surveillance in the region. Using an up-to-date database of published locational records for               An. stephensi               across its full range (Asia, Arabian Peninsula, Horn of Africa) and a set of spatial models that identify the environmental conditions that characterize a species' preferred habitat, we provide evidence-based maps predicting the possible locations across Africa where               An. stephensi               could establish if allowed to spread unchecked. Unsurprisingly, due to this species' close association with man-made habitats, our maps predict a high probability of presence within many urban cities across Africa where our estimates suggest that over 126 million people reside. Our results strongly support the WHO's call for surveillance and targeted vector control and provide a basis for the prioritization of surveillance.},

They typically last less than 30 minutes. Activity must thus be highly synchronized between the sexes. Moreover, males must identify the few sporadically entering females by detecting the females' faint flight tones. We show that the               Anopheles               circadian clock not only ensures a tight synchrony of male and female activity but also helps sharpen the males' acoustic detection system: By raising their flight tones to 1.5 times the female flight tone, males enhance the audibility of females, specifically at swarm time. Previously reported ``harmonic convergence'' events are only a random by-product of the mosquitoes' flight tone variance and not a signature of acoustic interaction between males and females. The flight tones of individual mosquitoes occupy narrow, partly non-overlapping frequency ranges, suggesting that the audibility of individual females varies across males.},

With their extensive diversification, ecological variation and burgeoning genomic resources, mosquitoes are an ideal group to identify patterns of trait variation and suggest causal evolutionary mechanisms. Here we discuss the mating systems of Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, vectors of major infectious diseases that afflict humanity. In this review, our emphasis is on interspecific comparisons of traits relevant to mechanisms of pre- and postcopulatory selection, including mating behaviour, molecular pathways of reproduction, postmating physiology and morphological traits. Based on a wealth of recent studies in mosquito genomics and phylogenetics, we provide an evolutionary context to examine adaptive changes in mosquito reproduction, their possible impact on pathogen transmission and their potential consequences for disease control.},

  abstract = {Female mosquitoes use odor and heat as cues to navigate to a suitable landing site on their blood host. The way these cues affect flight behavior and modulate anemotactic responses, however, is poorly understood. We studied in-flight behavioral responses of females of the nocturnal malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto to human odor and heat. Flightpath characteristics in a wind tunnel (flow 20 cm/s) were quantified in three dimensions. With wind as the only stimulus (control), short and close to straight upwind flights were recorded. With heat alone, flights were similarly short and direct. The presence of human odor, in contrast, caused prolonged and highly convoluted flight patterns. The combination of odor+heat resulted in longer flights with more landings on the source than to either cue alone. Flight speed was greatest (mean groundspeed 27.2 cm/s) for odor+heat. Odor alone resulted in decreased flight speed when mosquitoes arrived within 30 cm of the source whereas mosquitoes exposed to odor+heat maintained a high flight speed while flying in the odor plume, until they arrived within 15 cm of the source. Human odor evoked an increase in crosswind flights with an additive effect of heat at close range (,15 cm) to the source. This was found for both horizontal and vertical flight components. However, mosquitoes nevertheless made upwind progress when flying in the odor+heat generated plume, suggesting that mosquitoes scan their environment intensively while they progress upwind towards their host. These observations may help to improve the efficacy of trapping systems for malaria mosquitoes by (1) optimizing the site of odor release relative to trap entry and (2) adding a heat source which enhances a landing response.},

  abstract = {The health impact of mosquito-borne diseases causes a huge burden on human societies. Recent vector control campaigns have resulted in promising declines in incidence and prevalence of these diseases, notably malaria, but resistance to insecticides and drugs are on the rise, threatening to overturn these gains. Moreover, several vector-borne diseases have re-emerged, requiring prompt and effective response measures. To improve and properly implement vector control interventions, the behaviour of the vectors must be well understood with detailed examination of mosquito flight being an essential component. Current knowledge on mosquito behaviour across its life history is briefly presented, followed by an overview of recent developments in automated tracking techniques for detailed interpretation of mosquito behaviour. These techniques allow highly accurate recording and observation of mating, feeding and oviposition behaviour. Software programmes built with specific algorithms enable quantification of these behaviours. For example, the crucial role of heat on host landing and the multimodal integration of carbon dioxide (CO2) with other host cues, has been unravelled based on three-dimensional tracking of mosquito flight behaviour. Furthermore, the behavioural processes underlying house entry and subsequent host searching and finding can be better understood by analysis of detailed flight recordings. Further potential of these technologies to solve knowledge gaps is discussed. The use of tracking techniques can support or replace existing monitoring tools and provide insights on mosquito behaviour that can lead to innovative and more effective vector-control measures.},

  abstract = {Mosquito hearing is a complex process primarily involved in intraspecific communication between males and females. Although mosquitoes previously were believed to possess a relatively rudimentary auditory system, we now know that they can hear sounds at greater distances and process sounds through an efferent pathway, similar to vertebrates. In mating swarms, mosquitoes use acoustic signals created by conspecific wingbeats to locate and respond to one another through harmonic convergence. Male capture is an emerging area of interest for monitoring sterile insect release programs, and numerous studies have explored using female flight tones (wing-beat frequencies) to attract and capture male mosquitoes by altering or developing novel acoustic traps. It is also important to consider sound pattern, volume, and sound pressure levels of broadcasted noises, as well as implementing other attractive cues, such as swarm markers, to acoustic traps to increase success in the field. Female attraction to sound-baited traps has also been explored in the laboratory and field, using frequencies similar to male wing-beats and stereotypical vertebrate host calls, such as frogs and birds. In this review, the physiological and behavioral aspects of mosquito hearing are explored, as well as the importance of acoustic signals for mate choice and successful mating.The use of acoustic traps for male and female capture are discussed, as well as the implications for vector surveillance, and the limitations to using these traps.},

  abstract = {In the dance fly Empis borealis (E.) (Diptera: Fmpididae) females gather to swarm and males visit swarms for mating. A model was constructed, based on previously published data, simulating how males may choose among females of different sizes in swarms of different sizes. The focal question was, what influences the number of individuals in the swarm in this and possibly other swarming insects? The relationships between original swarm size and both the number of males arriving per minute and the proportion of males mating are both logarithmic. The model predicted that if these relationships were linear, or if males were able to judge absolute female size, the mean swarm size should increase and be at least four times as large as those found in the fleld. The only type of male mate choice strategy that gave rise to very large swarms ({$>$}25) was size-related choice (if males are able to assess the size of a female in relation to the entire population and not merely to the swarm). Furthermore, no swarming behaviour would occur if males mate independently of swarm size. Thus, the numbers of females attending a given swarm site are influenced by male arrival pattern, male preference for larger swarms, the inability of males to judge the absolute body size of females, and female polyandry. Males searching for mates seem to prefer larger swarms than females searching for a swarm to join, but the mean swarm size is primarily set by the swarm size preference of females. Optimal swarm size predicted from the model was 4.68 + 0.53 females. In order to test model predictions, 69 natural swarm sites were studied during one season. The mean swarm size was 4.85 + 4.54 females (median 4.03), and about 90\% of swarms consisted of 11 females or fewer. Predicted and observed swarm size did not differ significantly.},

  abstract = {Female dance-flies, Empis borealis L., gather to swarm, and males carrying nuptial gifts visit swarms for mating. Field observations and experiments were performed on this behaviorally sex-role reversed species to test models of lekking behavior. The key predictions were: (1) female preference model: male visiting rate and mating rate should increase with the number of females in swarm (swarm size), (2) hotspot model: male visiting rate should be independent of swarm size, and (3) hotshot model: swarm size should be positively correlated with the body size of the largest female in swarm. We found that male visiting rate and mating rate increased with swarm size, and that mating rate per female increased with swarm size. Males also mated more often in larger swarms than in smaller ones. Both males and females visited swarm sites even in the absence of other individuals. When females were successively removed from swarm sites more males than females on average arrived at these sites: 2.25 males per female. When no individuals were present at the swarm site, arriving males moved on to another site, whereas arriving females generally stayed. Larger experimental swarm-markers attracted both more males and more females and even more males when swarming females were present. There was no correlation between mean or median female size in swarms and the number of females in swarms. Thus, the female preference model and the hotspot model were corroborated, while other models were judged unlikely to explain swarming behavior in E. borealis.},

Their ability to transmit this disease of major public health importance is dependent on their abundance, biting behaviour, susceptibility and their ability to survive long enough to transmit malaria parasites. A deeper understanding of this behaviour can be exploited for improving vector surveillance and malaria control.                                                        Findings               Adult mosquitoes emerge from aquatic habitats at dusk. After a 24 h teneral period, in which the cuticle hardens and the adult matures, they may disperse at random and search upwind for a mate or to feed. Mating generally takes place at dusk in swarms that form over species-specific `markers'. Well-nourished females may mate before blood-feeding, but the reverse is true for poorly-nourished insects. Females are monogamous and only mate once whilst males, that only feed on nectar, swarm nightly and can potentially mate up to four times. Females are able to locate hosts by following their carbon dioxide and odour gradients.~When in close proximity to the host, visual cues, temperature and relative humidity are also used. Most blood-feeding occurs at night, indoors, with mosquitoes entering houses mainly through gaps between the roof and the walls. With the exception of the first feed, females are gonotrophically concordant and a blood meal gives rise to a complete egg batch. Egg development takes two or three days depending on temperature. Gravid females leave their resting sites at dusk. They are attracted by water gradients and volatile chemicals that provide a suitable aquatic habitat in which to lay their eggs.                                         Conclusion               Whilst traditional interventions, using insecticides, target mosquitoes indoors, additional protection can be achieved using spatial repellents outdoors, attractant traps or house modifications to prevent mosquito entry. Future research on the variability of species-specific behaviour, movement of mosquitoes across the landscape, the importance of light and vision, reproductive barriers to gene flow, male mosquito behaviour and evolutionary changes in mosquito behaviour could lead to an improvement in malaria surveillance and better methods of control reducing the current over-reliance on the indoor application of insecticides.},

  abstract = {Nuptial gift-giving is one of the most remarkable traits to have evolved among animal mating systems, and has brought about numerous hypotheses regarding their evolution and influence. Yet, their study has been confined to the modern fauna owing to their ephemeral nature and lack of traces on the environment suitable for preservation. Here we report the first paleontological and earliest evidence of nuptial gift-giving behavior from a male fly of Alavesia (Diptera: Empidoidea) that is an obligate flower visitor in Cretaceous amber carrying his gift, an empty frothy balloon. The fossil demonstrates the antiquity of this behavior, its occurrence in early diverging lineages of Empidoidea, and its maintenance over 99 million years. The nature of the fossil gift provides clues into the function of swarming and the diversity of gifts employed. Based on the phylogenetic pattern of feeding and mating traits, it is inferred that the gift initially alleviated nutrient pressure on females and may have been empty and secreted from male salivary glands in the first place, those with prey items inside were derived later. The evolution of these mating systems may have been a response to maximizing the usage of exogenous nutrients and for signal transmission.},

In females from these species, sexual transfer of male accessory gland products, including the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), induces vast behavioral, physiological, and transcriptional changes that profoundly shape their post-mating ecology, and that may have contributed to the insurgence of post-mating, prezygotic reproductive barriers. As these barriers can be detected by studying transcriptional changes induced by mating, we set out to analyze the post-mating response of               An. gambiae               and               An. coluzzii               females captured in natural mating swarms in Burkina Faso. While the molecular pathways shaping short- and long-term mating-induced changes are largely conserved in females from the two species, we unravel significant inter-specific differences that suggest divergent regulation of key reproductive processes such as egg development, processing of seminal secretion, and mating behavior, that may have played a role in reproductive isolation. Interestingly, a number of these changes occur in genes previously shown to be regulated by the sexual transfer of 20E and may be due to divergent utilization of this steroid hormone in the two species.},

  abstract = {Background: The Indian city of Chennai is endemic for malaria and the known local malaria vector is Anopheles stephensi. Plasmodium vivax is the predominant malaria parasite species, though Plasmodium falciparum is present at low levels. The urban ecotype of malaria prevails in Chennai with perennial transmission despite vector surveillance by the Urban Malaria Scheme (UMS) of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP). Understanding the feeding and resting preferences, together with the transmission potential of adult vectors in the area is essential in effective planning and execution of improved vector control measures. Methods: A yearlong survey was carried out in cattle sheds and human dwellings to check the resting, feeding preferences and transmission potential of An. stephensi. The gonotrophic status, age structure, resting and host seeking preferences were studied. The infection rate in An. stephensi and Anopheles subpictus were analysed by circumsporozoite ELISA (CS-ELISA). Results: Adult vectors were found more frequently and at higher densities in cattle sheds than human dwellings. The overall Human Blood Index (HBI) was 0.009 indicating the vectors to be strongly zoophilic. Among the vectors collected from human dwellings, 94.2\% were from thatched structures and the remaining 5.8\% from tiled and asbestos structures. 57.75\% of the dissected vectors were nulliparous whereas, 35.83\% were monoparous and the rest 6.42\% biparous. Sporozoite positivity rate was 0.55\% (4/720) and 1.92\% (1/52) for An. stephensi collected from cattle sheds and human dwellings, respectively. One adult An. subpictus (1/155) was also found to be infected with P. falciparum. Conclusions: Control of the adult vector populations can be successful only by understanding the resting and feeding preferences. The present study indicates that adult vectors predominantly feed on cattle and cattle sheds are the preferred resting place, possibly due to easy availability of blood meal source and lack of any insecticide or repellent pressure. Hence targeting these resting sites with cost effective, socially acceptable intervention tools, together with effective larval source management to reduce vector breeding, could provide an improved integrated vector management strategy to help drive down malaria transmission and assist in India's plan to eliminate malaria by 2030.},

These cues may include intrinsic aspects of a male's phenotype as well as aspects of the environment associated with the male. The role of the spatial location of a potential mate has been well studied in territorial vertebrates. However, despite their role as laboratory models for studies of sexual selection, the potential for insects to choose their mates on the basis of location has scarcely been studied. We studied a natural population of individually tagged crickets (Gryllus campestris) in a meadow in Northern Spain. Adults typically move between burrows every few days, allowing us to examine how pairing success of males can be predicted by the burrow they occupy, independent of their own characteristics. We observed the entirety of ten independent breeding seasons to provide replication and to determine whether the relative importance of these factors is stable across years. We find that both male ID and the ID his burrow affect the likelihood that he is paired with a female, but the burrow has a consistently greater influence. Furthermore, the two factors interact: the relative attractiveness of an individual male depends on which burrow he occupies. Our finding demonstrates a close interaction between naturally and sexually selected traits. It also demonstrates that mate choice studies may benefit from considering not only obvious secondary sexual traits, but also more cryptic traits such as microhabitat choice.},

Inseminated females with developed ovaries (egglayers) tended to have larger body size (measured at the median cell of the forewing) than non egg-layers. Two way ANOVA revealed that the difference in body size was related to both the caste and the colony of origin. The genetic relatedness among egg-layers as detected by electrophoresis was 0.336 {\textpm} 0.114 (mean {\textpm} se), and that among non egg-layers was 0.161 {\textpm} 0.035. The inbreeding coefficient among non egg-layers was found to be significantly greater than zero, but this did not seem to play a major part in the increase in relatedness among progeny. The number of effective queens (mothers of new queens) was estimated to be 2.84 per colony. This number is much smaller than the actual counts of queens. This discrepancy is discussed in terms of possibilities that wasps practice cyclical oligogyny, matriline localization within a colony, and genotypic behavioral specialization.},

  abstract = {Blood-feeding, which is necessary for most female mosquitoes to reproduce, provides an opportunity for pathogen transmission. Blood-feeding is influenced by external factors such as light, temperature, humidity and intra- and inter-specific interactions. Physiologically, blood-feeding cycles are linked to nutritional conditions and governed by conserved hormonal signalling pathways that prepare mosquito sensory systems to locate and evaluate hosts. Human activities also alter mosquito blood-feeding behaviour through selection pressures such as insecticide usage, habitat and ecosystem alterations, and climate change. Notably, blood-feeding behaviour changes within a mosquito's lifespan, an underexplored phenomenon from an epidemiological standpoint. A review of the literature indicates that our understanding of mosquito biology and blood-feeding behaviour is predominantly based on studies of a handful of primarily tropical species. This focus likely skews our comprehension of the diversity of critical drivers of blood-feeding behaviour, especially under constraints imposed by harsh conditions. We found evidence of remarkable adaptability in blood-feeding and significant knowledge gaps regarding the determinants of host use. Specifically, epidemiological analyses assume host use is modified by external factors, while neglecting internal physiology. Integrating all significant factors is essential for developing effective models of mosquito-borne disease transmission in a rapidly changing world.},

Before swarms form, locust populations exhibit a dramatic phase change from a solitary to a gregarious phase. The cause of this phase change is a complicated interplay of conspecific and environmental cues and is, especially for one of the major pests, the migratory locust Locusta migratoria, still not well understood. Here we study the behavior of both solitary and gregarious L. migratoria towards the headspace odors of conspecifics. As we do not find a general attraction of gregarious animals to the headspace of gregarious conspecifics, swarm formation does not seem to be mainly governed by olfactory aggregation cues. When testing for potential mating signals, we observe that the headspace of virgin gregarious females is highly attractive only towards virgin males of the same phase, while mated gregarious males and solitary males, regardless of their mating state, do not become attracted. Interestingly, this phase-specific attraction goes along with the finding, that mating behavior in experiments with inter-phasic pairings is extremely rare. Our data suggest that odor emissions in L. migratoria play a significant role in a mating context.},

During this take-off, she has to carry a large payload, up to three times her body weight, while avoiding tactile detection by the host. What separates the malaria mosquito from most other insects is that the mosquito pushes off gently with its legs while producing aerodynamic forces with its wings. Apart from generating the required forces, the malaria mosquito has to produce the correct torques to pitch-up during take-off. Furthermore, the fed mosquito has to alter the direction of its aerodynamic force vector to compensate for the higher body pitch angle due to its heavier abdomen. Whether the mosquito generates these torques and redirection of the forces with its wings or legs remains unknown. By combining rigid-body inverse dynamics analyses with computational fluid dynamics simulations, we show that mosquitoes use leg push-off to control pitch torques and that the adaption of the aerodynamic force direction is synchronized with modulations in force magnitude. These results suggest that during the push-off phase of a take-off, mosquitoes use their flight apparatus primarily as a motor system and they use leg push-off forces for control.},

This is widely interpreted as a host-driven response aimed at compensating for the expected losses in future fitness as a result of parasitism. Here we report that mosquitoes bring forward their oviposition schedule when they are infected with Plasmodium, a parasite known to severely curtail mosquito fecundity. This response could aim at compensating for a negative time-dependent effect of the parasite on mosquito fitness, as infected mosquitoes seem to display a strong and progressive decrease in the quality of the eggs they lay. In addition, we show that this shift in oviposition date is dependent on mosquito strain: a comparison of several isogenic mosquitoes strains, one insecticide-susceptible and two insecticide-resistant ones, reveals that only the former shift their oviposition strategy when infected. This pattern suggests the existence of a costly host-driven response to parasitism, as insecticide-resistant mosquitoes have been shown to be in generally poorer condition.},

In this study, we examined the effect of photoperiod and relative humidity on morphologic and chemical traits known to control water loss in mosquitoes. Methods: Anopheles gambiae body size (indexed by wing length), mesothoracic spiracle size, and cuticular hydrocarbon composition (both standardized by body size) were examined in mosquitoes raised from eggs exposed to short photoperiod and low relative humidity, simulating the dry season, or long photoperiod and high relative humidity, simulating the wet-season. Results: Mosquitoes exposed to short photoperiod exhibited larger body size and larger mesothoracic spiracle length than mosquitoes exposed to long photoperiod. Mosquitoes exposed to short photoperiod and low relative humidity exhibited greater total cuticular hydrocarbon amount than mosquitoes exposed to long photoperiod and high relative humidity. In addition, total cuticular hydrocarbon amount increased with age and was higher in mated females. Mean n-alkane retention time (a measure of cuticular hydrocarbon chain length) was lower in mosquitoes exposed to short photoperiod and low relative humidity, and increased with age. Individual cuticular hydrocarbon peaks were examined, and several cuticular hydrocarbons were identified as potential biomarkers of dry- and wet-season conditions, age, and insemination status. Conclusions: Results from this study indicate that morphological and chemical changes underlie aestivation of Anopheles gambiae and may serve as biomarkers of aestivation.},

  abstract = {Cuticular pheromone circadian regulation                            Several species of anopheline mosquitoes are important malaria vectors in Africa. Male mosquitoes show species-specific swarming behaviors at certain times of the day to attract females for mating. Wang               et al.               found that transcriptional patterns of metabolic and immune function genes apparently showed a diurnal rhythm that correlated with the physiological demands of mating flight swarming (see the Perspective by Manoukis). By altering temperature and light regimes and by knocking out the master genes               period               and               timeless               for circadian clock regulation, the authors disrupted mating flight behavior in a combination of cage experiments and enclosed field conditions. Knocking out the rhythmically expressed desaturase enzyme reduced cuticular hydrocarbon pheromone production and limited mating success. These key interacting components of the diurnal regulation of mosquito mating behavior are potential targets for alternative malaria control strategies.

Here, we show that mosquito swarming and mating are coordinately guided by clock genes, light, and temperature. Transcriptome analysis shows up-regulation of the clock genes               period               (               per               ) and               timeless               (               tim               ) in the head of field-caught swarming               Anopheles coluzzii               males.

  abstract = {A caste system in which females develop into morphologically distinct queens or workers has evolved independently in ants, wasps and bees. Although such reproductive division of labour may benefit the colony it is also a source of conflict because individual immature females can benefit from developing into a queen in order to gain greater direct reproduction. Here we present a formal inclusive fitness analysis of caste fate conflict appropriate for swarm-founding social Hymenoptera. Three major conclusions are reached: (1) when caste is self-determined, many females should selfishly choose to become queens and the resulting depletion of the workforce can substantially reduce colony productivity; (2) greater relatedness among colony members reduces this excess queen production; (3) if workers can prevent excess queen production at low cost by controlled feeding, a transition to nutritional caste determination should occur. These predictions generalize results derived earlier using an allele-frequency model [Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol. (2001) 50: 467] and are supported by observed levels of queen production in various taxa, especially stingless bees, where caste can be either individually or nutritionally controlled.},

  abstract = {Ornamental traits function by improving attractiveness and are generally presumed to experience directional selection for mating success. However, given the greater investment of females in offspring than males, femalespecific ornaments can in theory signal fecundity yet be constrained by fecundity costs. Theoretical work predicts that such constraints can lead to stabilizing selection via male choice for intermediately ornamented females. Female dance flies Rhamphomyia longicauda (Diptera: Empididae) display two female-specific ornaments in mating swarms -- inflatable abdominal sacs and pinnate tibial scales. We investigated the intensity and form of sexual selection on female traits including ornaments and found no evidence for directional sexual selection. Instead, we found marginally nonsignificant quadratic selection for all three measures of ornament expression. Canonical analysis confirmed that the strongest vectors of nonlinear selection were associated with ornamental traits, although the significance of the quadratic coefficients associated with these vectors depended on the statistical approach. Direct Mitchell-Olds and Shaw tests for the location of the maximum fitted fitness value for both raw morphological traits and canonical axes revealed only one marginally nonsignificant result for the multivariate axis loading most heavily on pinnate leg scales. Together, these results provide the first tentative support for stabilizing selection on female-specific ornaments.},

  abstract = {Males and females exhibit highly dimorphic phenotypes, particularly in their gonads, which is believed to be driven largely by differential gene expression. Typically, the protein sequences of genes upregulated in males, or male-biased genes, evolve rapidly as compared to female-biased and unbiased genes. To date, the specific study of gonad-biased genes remains uncommon in metazoans. Here, we identified and studied a total of 2927, 2013, and 4449 coding sequences (CDS) with ovary-biased, testis-biased, and unbiased expression, respectively, in the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti. The results showed that ovary-biased and unbiased CDS had higher nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) and lower optimal codon usage (those codons that promote efficient translation) than testis-biased genes. Further, we observed higher dN/dS in ovary-biased genes than in testis-biased genes, even for genes coexpressed in nonsexual (embryo) tissues. Ovary-specific genes evolved exceptionally fast, as compared to testis- or embryo-specific genes, and exhibited higher frequency of positive selection. Genes with ovary expression were preferentially involved in olfactory binding and reception. We hypothesize that at least two potential mechanisms could explain rapid evolution of ovarybiased genes in this mosquito: (1) the evolutionary rate of ovary-biased genes may be accelerated by sexual selection (including female--female competition or male--mate choice) affecting olfactory genes during female swarming by males, and/or by adaptive evolution of olfactory signaling within the female reproductive system (e.g., sperm-ovary signaling); and/or (2) testis-biased genes may exhibit decelerated evolutionary rates due to the formation of mating plugs in the female after copulation, which limits male--male sperm competition.},

  abstract = {The use of semiochemicals in odour-based traps for surveillance and control of vector mosquitoes is deemed a new and viable component for integrated vector management programmes. Over 114 semiochemicals have been identified, yet implementation of these for management of infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya and Rift Valley fever is still a major challenge. The difficulties arise due to variation in how different mosquito species respond to not only single chemical compounds but also complex chemical blends. Additionally, mosquitoes respond to different volatile blends when they are looking for a mating partner, oviposition sites or a meal. Analytically the challenge lies not only in correctly identifying these semiochemical signals and cues but also in developing formulations that effectively mimic blend ratios that different mosquito species respond to. Only then can the formulations be used to enhance the selectivity and efficacy of odour-based traps. Understanding how mosquitoes use semiochemical cues and signals to survive may be key to unravelling these complex interactions. An overview of the current studies of these chemical messages and the chemical ecology involved in complex behavioural patterns is given. This includes an updated list of the semiochemicals which can be used for integrated vector control management programmes. A thorough understanding of these semiochemical cues is of importance for the development of new vector control methods that can be integrated into established control strategies.},

  abstract = {Patterns are pervasive in nature with many examples being found in both living and inanimate systems. While researchers recognize the importance of the behavior of individuals to the structure and shape of an aggregation, a major hurdle in describing aggregated organisms has been the difficulty of tracking the movement of individuals over time. Here we present an innovative application of an analytical technique derived from statistical mechanics (a subfield of physics) to describe the spatial distribution of grouped organisms. Radial distribution and pair-correlation functions are traditionally used by physicists to describe inert particle dynamics. This novel biological application allows one to infer the behavioral characteristics of individuals within a group based solely on the spatial distribution of the aggregate population. Additionally, the method allows one to determine the correlation length, the average maximum distance over which one individual may exert an influence on another member of the aggregation. The analytical technique presented here is also important in that it minimizes two problems that typically plague studies of grouped organisms: it eliminates the need to track the movements of individuals, and it partially takes into account the presence of occluded individuals. This technique also permits quantitative comparison between aggregations formed under various environmental and/or experimental conditions. Thus, this technique may be of value to resource managers, ecologists, and others working with grouped organisms (e.g., plankton swarms, schooling fish, flocking birds, or migratory mammals) who seek to gain information about factors influencing the structure and behavior of such groups.},

  abstract = {The tribe Hilarini (Diptera: Empididae), commonly known as dance flies, can be recognised by their swollen silk-producing prothoracic basitarsus, a male secondary sexual characteristic. The ultrastructure and function of the silk-producing basitarsus from one undescribed morphospecies of Hilarini, `Hilarempis 20', is presented. Male H. 20 collect small parcels of diatomaceous algae from the surface of freshwater creeks that they bind with silk produced by the gland in the basitarsus. The gift is then presented to females in a nearby swarm, composed predominately of females. The basitarsus houses approximately 12 pairs of class III dermal glandular units that congregate on the ventral side of the cavity. Each gland cell has a large extracellular lumen where secretion accumulates. The lumen drains to the outside via a conducting canal encompassed by a canal cell and a duct extending through the shaft of a specialised secretory spine. The secretory spines lie in pairs in a ventral groove that runs the length of the basitarsus. A comparison of the basitarsal secretory spines with sensilla on the basitarsi of non gland-bearing legs of males, and with non gland-bearing prothoracic basitarsi of females, suggests that the glandular units are derived from contact chemosensory sensilla.},

The objective of this study was to determine, in the field, the energetic costs of swarming for male                     Anopheles freeborni                     (Diptera: Culicidae). By comparing the caloric contents of resting males to marked males captured after swarming, we established when sugar feeding takes place, what energy source is used to fuel swarming flight, and how much energy is invested in this activity.                                                                        Sugar-feeding takes place sometime during the night after swarming is concluded. Nectar sugars are therefore not immediately available to fuel flight. Stored sugars (trehalose and glucose) and glycogen are the primary sources of energy for flight. Lipids are not used to fuel flight but may be used in resting metabolism.                                                     Male size is not related to feeding success. For males of all sizes, swarming consumes more than 50\% of available calories. Accordingly, the ability of an individual to find and exploit nectar sources will greatly affect reproductive success.},

  abstract = {Background: Anopheles funestus has been recognized as a major malaria vector in Africa for over 100 years, but knowledge on many aspects of the biology of this species is still lacking. Anopheles funestus, as with most other anophelines, mate through swarming. A key event that is crucial for the An. funestus male to mate is genitalia rotation. This involves the 135{$^\circ$} to 180{$^\circ$} rotation of claspers, which are tipped with claws. This physical change then enables the male to grasp the female during copulation. The aim of this investigation was to molecularly characterize wild An. funestus swarms from Zambia and examine the degree of genitalia rotation within the swarm. Methods: Anopheles funestus swarms were collected from Nchelenge, northern Zambia, during dusk periods in May 2016. All the adults from the swarm were analysed morphologically and identified to species level using a multiplex PCR assay. Anopheles funestus s.s. specimens were molecularly characterized by restriction fragment length polymor-phism type and Clade type assays. The different stages of genitalia rotation were examined in the adult males. Results: A total of six swarms were observed during the study period and between 6 and 26 mosquitoes were caught from each swarm. Species analysis revealed that 90\% of the males from the swarms were An. funestus s.s. MW-type, with 84\% belonging to clade I compared to 14\% clade II and 2\% failed to amplify. Very few specimens (3.4\%) were identified as Anopheles gambiae s.s. Eighty percent of the males from the swarm had complete genitalia rotation. Conclusions: This is the first time that An. funestus swarms have been molecularly identified to species level. Anopheles funestus swarms appear to be species-specific with no evidence of clade-type differentiation within these swarms. The An. funestus swarms consist mainly of males with fully rotated genitalia, which strongly suggests that swarming behaviour is triggered primarily when males have matured.},

  abstract = {Migratory locusts (Locusta migratoria) frequently aggregate into huge swarms that cause serious economic losses for the agricultural sector. Differential behaviors of male and female insects may contribute to such population explosions. However, the key olfactory mechanisms underlying different behaviors associated with sex-related pheromones are unclear. Here, we report that male-specific odor, 2-heptanone plays different roles in relation to the behavior of migratory locust males and females, and that this sexual dimorphism involves a soluble odorantbinding protein (OBP) in the peripheral olfactory processes. This odor strongly binds to LmigOBP4, a novel OBP, present in antennal trichoid sensilla, and elicits opposite locomotor tendencies between the sexes: attracting females and repelling males. Furthermore, an adult male group mimicked a high dosage of 2-heptanone by promoting their attractiveness to single females. Additionally, RNAi suppression of Lmigobp4 expression reduced the physiological responses to 2-heptanone to levels that were indistinguishable between the sexes. This suppression reversed the adult behavioral responses to 2-heptanone, i.e., females were repelled and males were attracted. We conclude that LmigOBP4 is associated with olfactory recognition of male-specific 2-heptanone, which plays dual roles that differ between adult male and female migratory locusts.},

  abstract = {Rapidly increasing pyrethroid insecticide resistance and changes in vector biting and resting behavior pose serious challenges in malaria control. Mosquito repellents, especially spatial repellents, have received much attention from industry. We attempted to simulate interactions between mosquitoes and repellents using a machine learning method, the Self-Propelled Particle (SPP) model, which we modified to include attractiveness/repellency effects. We simulated a random walk scenario and scenarios with insecticide susceptible/resistant mosquitoes against repellent alone and against repellent plus attractant (to mimic a human host). Simulation results indicated that without attractant/repellent, mosquitoes would fly anywhere in the cage at random. With attractant, all mosquitoes were attracted to the source of the odor by the end. With repellent, all insecticide-susceptible mosquitoes eventually moved to the corner of the cage farthest from the repellent release point, whereas, a high proportion of highly resistant mosquitoes might reach the attractant release point (the human) earlier in the simulation. At fixed concentration, a high proportion of mosquitoes could be able to reach the host when the relative repellency efficacy (compare to attractant efficacy) was {$<$}1, whereas, no mosquitoes reached the host when the relative repellency efficacy was {$>$} 1. This result implies that repellent may not be sufficient against highly physiologically insecticide resistant mosquitoes, since very high concentrations of repellent are neither practically feasible nor cost-effective.},
